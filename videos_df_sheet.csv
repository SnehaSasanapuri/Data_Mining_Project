Limits are used to find horizontal and vertical asymptotes (notable features of functions) and are in the definition for continuity and the derivative of a function (we'll see in a future ep!) 

We see some techniques for evaluating limits when you're not feeling the numerical approach (or the limit property approach!) Creating ratios by multiplying by the conjugate and dividing numerator and denominator by the highest power of x in the denominator (try and parse why that works, I say to myself.)

Also we see a great theorem, the sandwich theorem, which helps us bound limited range functions and hopefully find their limit.

In the last video the spider learned a mapping from sensor readings to joint angles using a neural network. That way I could feed a desired sensor reading or tilt into the network, and it would output joint angles that should make the robot tilt that way!

In this video I have the robot try and keep himself balanced without my control. All it takes is a short loop, where a sensor reading comes in telling the bot it's current tilt, which then gets negated and fed into the network. Joint angles come out and go to the motors that should tilt the bot in the opposite direction... and that's it! It works fairly well, though there's some oscillation if the bot overcorrects which causes it to swing the sensor all around. 

Some future ideas are to combine some previous code I wrote to get the trained neural net on the arduino itself and let the bot walk around unwired! Another project will be to design some simple reward function and have the bot try and optimize it, like forward motion wile staying balanced.

Thanks for watching!

A quick warning... I developed this tool for personal use only so I can't guarantee it's bug free and will work 100% for everything you'd like to use it for. It's functional enough to explore simple math expressions or make short presentation style like animations.

Woah! Now that's what I'm talking about!!!

Though wait... damn. The authors must have had to carefully hand engineer each creature's reward function (reinforcement learning) to reward jumping, dodging, turning etc.

That's a pain.. oh well.. we might as well dive into all the different reward functions: 

Move to the right = Good.

Uhhhh... where are the rest? That's all of them!!?!

Wait a minute.. so then how can these agents learn such sweet moves? The secret is in....

The environment!
er.. more blocky..
Ok now lose the textures...

Using procedurally generated environments, that get more difficult in time (the hurdles get higher, and gaps get wider.. etc.), the AI agents learn all these moves themselves!

This is a type of increasing difficulty is called curriculum learning, aka you have to learn the alphabet before you can write.

The procedural nature of the environments give the agent a lot of variety as well, which reduces brittle policies that overfit to only one type of environment.

(overfit https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Overfitting.svg) 

THE TAKE AWAY: (show bag) (and great quote from the discussion at the end of the paper) ""... choosing a seemingly more complex environment may actually make learning easier.""

PAPER 2: ""Learning human behaviors from motion capture by adversarial imitation""

Those guys had some sweet moves, but they weren't moving like us very much.

So how can we make them a little more human?

(orosetta.mp3 http://www.jsayles.com/familypages/earlymusic.htm)

We've been trying to imitate our own motions for centuries.

This bot was possibly created by Leonardo da Vinci all the way back in 1495.

It could sit and stand, move its arms, and even had an anatomically correct jaw.

It's behavior was programmable, but rigid. It basically repeated the same motions as you turned a crank.

Reinforcement learning allows us to impart our modern day robot (simulations) with really diverse behaviors that are conditioned on their environments.

(openai.mov https://gym.openai.com/envs#mujoco)

The only issue is they sometimes move like this:

How did the authors make their bots more human? Motion capture data!

http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/search.php?subjectnumber=9

They use this mocap data, but how do they GENERATE new behaviors?

GANs of course! 

(ganapataye ding https://freesound.org/people/ganapataye/sounds/390201/)

A discriminator network tries to classify movements (state+action pairs) as coming from mocap or from a different network imitating the mocap data.

(GAN diagram https://tryolabs.com/blog/2016/12/06/major-advancements-deep-learning-2016/)

The imitation network is rewarded for fooling the discriminator. 

Why do it this way? They're trying to get movements similar to human ones right? With this technique the ""similarity"" of imitation vs. generated movements doesn't have to be defined... which is a great thing. It's now the discriminator's job and not ours (yay automation!) 

Some cool benefits: transitions between behaviors are learned automatically and are realistic in appearance, just like you can transition age or other latent variables and get semantically relevant outputs from image GANs.

(GAN.mov https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLLKNgzaDW4)

The TAKEAWAY: Imitate human behavior first, then fine tune and repurpose with generative training. 

PAPER 3: ""Robust Imitation of Diverse Behaviors""

Here's an agent trained with just a generative model:

The guys moving alright, but suffers from mode collapse (picking one behavior over others) and lack of diversity in behaviors.

How do the authors fix this? 

They combine strengths of GANS and VAEs (supervised) of course!

Generative models: robust policies, but undiverse behaviors (mode collapse).
VAEs (supervised): not as robust, but learn diverse behaviors. 

I mean.. it was obvious right? (not obvious, great work!)

We also see the same great transition ability between different behaviors:

and the ability to generate new behaviors from a single observation.

TAKE AWAY: Use advantages of both geneative (GANs) and supervised (VAEs) methods to 
""obtain robust policies capturing diverse behaviors"" -paper

Loose script I worked from:

What is it? 

An easy way to train reinforcement learning agents.

What's cool about it? 

It's simple to do, and it can be parallelized easily, and it's competative with standard methods in RL. 

How does it work?

Well, here's the typical RL scenario: an agent and environment, where the agent emits actions that effect the environment, which then returns its new state and a reward r. 

The agent wants to change its actions to maximize total expected reward.

How is this done typically? 

Well the environment spits out a state, the agent transforms that state using a differentiable function (typically a neural network) into a probability distribution over actions. It samples an action using that distribution, and executes it in the environment, which in turn spits out a new state and reward. If the reward is good, we should increase the probability of the action the agent took in that state. Using the gradient of the neural network, we can do just that.

What's different with evolution strats?

We modify the agent's weights in its network with random gaussian noise, get a reward from the environment, and if the reward was good we move our weights in the direction of the noise. We try many different ""directions"" of noise, and using the reward gotten for each, create a weighted average, which becomes our new weights.

This comes from a simple idea called the finite difference. It may sound complex but you're already familiar with it if you've watched my previous vids. Here's a visual demonstration of it.


Here's a simple example, where we have 2 parameters, and we sample slightly different ones. The landscape has more reward the more blue there is. We then get a weighted average of the samples and move our parameters in that direction! 

When we get a reward from the environment in a more complex example we'd be doing a rollout, or evaluating our parameters for a number of timesteps to see if they're good or not.

Here's a more complex example, where the parameters control this arms joint angles. I want to train it to move towards the mouse, so I pick random targets on screen, modify the arms weights and see if it gets closer with the modded weights. If so that's a positive reward. I then do the same thing, use a weighted average of the noise I applied to the weights to get the weight update!",2017-06-16T23:10:28Z,26589,867,0,false,PT9M31S,43

Solving the flower problem.

Our farmer wants to predict a flowers type, only knowing the width and length of its petal.

Here's what her data looks like:

length  width   type
3       1.5     1
2       1       0
4       1.5     1
3       1       0
3.5     .5      1
2       .5      0
5.5     1       1
1       1       0
4.5     1       ???

She wants to predict that last flowers color, and also end up with a neural network that can classify future flowers!

She has two inputs, so her network will have two inputs, length and width

She has one output, so the network will have one output

It will look like this:

nn(length, width) = sigmoid(w1 * length + w2 * width + b)

She uses sigmoid to squash the values between 0 and 1, since the flowers only have two types, she can consider outputs below .5 to be blue and above .5 to be red.

Let's look at what this network can do already:

We scatter some points on the x-z plane and consider the x-axis our length feature, and the z-axis our width feature.

For each grid point, we feed its coordinates into the network and get an output, that becomes the points y coordinate.

Now, we can play with w1 w2 and b and see what they do!

If we removed sigmoid check this out!

Ok, pretty cool.

So now we need to train.

The training procedure is to pick a random flower from our data, feed in its length and width to the net, and get an output. Then we get the squared error of the output with what it should have been given the data. 

For example, we pick this flower, 2, 1, 0.

We feed in 2, 1 and get out blip.

Because this is a blue flower we want to bring this output lower always.. as close to zero as possible.

Here's what the squared error looks like:

(nn(2,1) - 0)^2

notice that if we replace nn with its definition we just have a function of parameters

cost(w1, w2, b) = (sigmoid(w1*2 + w2 * 1 + b) - 0)^2

We take the partial of the cost w.r.t w1 w2 and b, which will give us three functions:

dcdw1
dcdw2
dcdb

which tell us how to change w1 w2 and b to INCREASE the cost.

We want to decrease the cost, so we instead subtract these partials.

Refer to the cost function video in this playlist on why this works if its hazy.

We update our parameters using a fraction of these partials.. and that will bring the output of our net closer to what we wanted it to be!

Now we repeat with a new random flower, and keep going until our networks output looks reasonable.

Because our dataset is so small, we're not going to split our data into train/test which we should usually do. That's something I'll cover in more advanced NN tutorials.

Ok, look at that! The nets output is looking good.

And here it is in javascript! Thanks to Alex Non for kicking that off!

So now we have trained weights in javascript, which we can feed values in and get out predictions! 

That's it for this beginner series... If you made it this far I'm proud of you haha!

122,UCrBzGHKmGDcwLFnQGHJ3XYg,Beginner Intro to Neural Networks 10: Finding Linear Regression Parameters,bP2SCk-QGkw,"Hey everyone!

In the last video we came up with this cost function:

cost = (wags(1)-2)^2 + (wags(2)-4)^2 + (wags(4)-5)^2

It changes when we change w and b. In this video we'll see how to find the right changes to w and b to make it go down! Doing so will get us the best possible fit for our model and data.

First let's expand the wags function in the cost function to see the entire thing:

cost(w,b) = (1*w+b-2)^2 + (2*w+b-4)^2 + (4*w+b-5)^2

You can see that since our data is already all plugged in, we end up with a function that takes two inputs in, our model's parameters, and outputs a single number.

Let's visualize our cost for different values of w and b!

Since our function takes two inputs instead of 1, we can introduce another axis of our coordinate system to get a better visualization.

We will make the x axis represent w, the z axis represent b, and the y axis represent the cost.

Let's pick a random w and b to start with now, and plot it.

It's sort of hard to tell with just a single point, so let's plot a whole grid of them!

Let's try every pair of integer values for w and b. 

(grid of w and b pairs)

And now we make their y axis the cost evaluated at whatever w and b coordiates they're at.

(bowl)

Now I'll connect each with a line just to make the visualiztion a bit more clear.

Woah!

Our cost looks like a bowl, and we want to get to the bottom of it!

We need to find how to change w and b to get to the bottom of this bowl. This is where the partial derivatives come in.

Here's the partial of the cost w.r.t. w, it's a function that takes where we currently are (w, b) and tells us how the cost changes for a small change in w. You can also think of it as the slope of the cost in the w dimension.

dcdw(w,b)=...

Here's the partial of the cost w.r.t. b, telling us how it changes for small changes in b:

dcdb(w,b)=...

I found these using rules from calculus (in particular the chain rule and power rule). But in practice you don't have to find these yourself (thankfully!). Many machine libraries like tensorflow, pytorch and theano will do it for you using something called automatic differentiation. We'll see more in later videos about how that works :-)

We have our update now! We plug in w and b into these two functions, simplify, and their answers tell us how to change w and b to make the cost increase!

Increase? Yes, so we actually have to subtract these numbers from w and b and the cost will then decrease.

(apply update over and over)

After a while our partial derivative functions approach zero, which is telling us we're either at a peak or basin of our surface... since remember, they're really functions that tell us the slope of the cost in the w and b dimensions, and when we're at a valley or peak the slope is zero!

Since our partial derivative functions are close to zero and our updates are therefore really small, we've trained our model and gotten (approximately) the best fitting line!

You can now use the model to make predictions! Plug in the w and b you found with your updates, then feed in new pats, simplify, simplify, and the number you get out is predicted wags for those pats!

Be careful not to use inputs that are widely out of the range that you had used to train your model or you may get weird results (like negative wags (would growls count as negative wags?)), this is called extrapolation.

There are many other things to be aware of as well when applying linear regression, so make sure you have a good understanding before applying it in real world situations. Things to be aware of are outliers, hidden variables, and not enough data to name a few.

Also the model doesn't tell you that the pats CAUSED the wags.. It's merely a relationship between wags and pats. You could have trained the model to predict pats from wags instead!).

In the next video I'll show you how do do all this stuff in python so you can experiment.

123,UCrBzGHKmGDcwLFnQGHJ3XYg,Beginner Intro to Neural Networks 9: Linear Regression Cost,fh1QZ97izSM,"Hey everyone!

In this video we're going to derive a cost function for linear regression.

(linear regression cost function)

In the last video we had some data points, and we wanted to fit a line to them by changing two parameters, w and b.

(entire scene, with data, scatter, model line, w and b, model predictions)

We can change these parameters by hand, but there's a better way!

(play with w and b)

If we look at what we're trying to do here, we're really trying to minimize these vertical differences between our models outputs and where the data says we should be.

let's focus in on our first data point.. if we look at the vertical difference, we have our model's output at pats_1 minus the wags for pats_1, aka wags_1.

wags(pats_1) - wags_1

now we want to square the difference, otherwise if we minimize just this we would push our models output negative and it would keep going forever!

(wags(pats_1) - wags_1)^2

now... if we just minimize this and ignore the other data points, we can push it all the way to zero...

(watch eval'd expression go to zero as we play with w and b, zoomed in)

but alas! we've messed up our models output for the other data points!

(zoom out and reveal others are messed up, oh no!)

so we need one BIG cost function that minimizes EACH of these smaller costs for each point.

That looks like this

cost = (wags(pats_1) - wags_1)^2 + (wags(pats_2) - wags_2)^2 + (wags(pats_3) - wags_3)^2

Let's play with w and b and watch the output of this cost function:

Huh.. there we go, we found about as good as we can by hand.

Some closing notes:

The general form of the cost function is this, with x being pats in our case and y being wags. 

sigma i=1,m (model(xi) - yi)^2

You can add a 1/m out front if you like, so you can interpret the cost as the average squared difference of your model and the data.

sigma i=1,m 1/m * (model(xi) - yi)^2

Now, not only does this big cost function tell us if some values of w and b are better than others, we can also use it's partial derivative w.r.t w and b to tell us exactly how to change our parameters to find the best fit automatically!

We'll check out how in the next video.

In this video we're going to look at something called linear regression.

We're really just adding an input to our super simple neural network (which was NN() = b) before. 

For those that know a bit about neural nets: I'm including this because we're getting one step closer to a full blown neural network. You can think of each hidden unit (before applying its activation function) as a multiple linear regression. So if we understand simple linear regression first, I'm hoping when we move up to bigger + more complex neural nets we'll have a stronger foundation.

-------

Let's jump into an example to see what this is and what it allows us to do.

Our farmer has a dog. She wants to learn more about her dog, and today specifically how many tail wags can she expect when she pats him on the head a certain number of times?

She knows that to answer her question, she should start by collecting some data.

To create an observation she pats his head a specific number of times, then records how many times he wags his tail.

To get a rough idea of any relationship between pats and wags, our farmer thinks visual thoughts... scatter plot! pats on x axis and wags on y axis, each observation is a point!

Woah! Look at that! It seems like the more pats there are, the more wags! Astonishing!

The points almost seem to follow a line... this hints that there is a ""linear"" relationship going on. 

What does our farmer think then? Linear regression!

Our farmer is going to use this equation to model the data. 

wags(pats) = w * pats + b

Aside: 
When I say model, all I mean is capture or distill some relationship from the data that will allow her to make predictions or learn something new about her data, like how many more wags can she expect if she pats one more time? Or how many wags for 1.5 pats?

It takes in the number of pats as an input

and multiplies it by some random weight we have to find w

then adds another random variable we need to find b to that

then we simplify and that's its prediction for number of wags!

let's bring back our data and graph our current model!

To generate pairs of points using our linear regression model, we need some random parameters first.

Then we use the same number of pats, and generate predictions by plugging those in one at a time and simplifying

Now we plot our models predictions, and see they're quite off

We can play with w and b by hand to minimize each prediction point's vertical distance to its corresponding data point (minimize the amount our model's predictions are off by what our data says) 

Now we can do this by hand of course, but a computer can do it much better!

In the next video we'll come up with a cost function that will get us closer to finding how to change w and b, in order to find the best line that fits the data.

I realize you can also just solve for w and b using the data alone and not treat it like an optimization problem, but for our purposes we're gaining useful experience for when that's not a possability.

125,UCrBzGHKmGDcwLFnQGHJ3XYg,Beginner Intro to Neural Networks 7: Slope of Cost + Simple Train in Python,EnGmg-kvpYs,"In the last video we saw three ways of finding the derivative of our cost function

Let's look at those ways using python

Start up the environment

Let's define our cost function, 

def cost(b):
    return (b - 4) ** 2
    
Let's find the derivative numerically first:

def num_slope(b):
    h = 0.0001
    return (cost(b+h) - cost(b))/h
    

Now let's define it the way we'll ultimately use:

def slope(b):
    return 2 * (b - 4)
    

Finally let's apply our slope to b to minimize the cost

We can start with any b we want here

b = 8

then write our update and run it over and over...

b = b - 0.1 * slope(b)
print(b)

if we run this over and over, b moves to the target!

Instead of running this ourselves, let's put our computer to work using a loop

we can instead write

for i in range(10):
    b = b - 0.1 * slope(b)
    print(b)
    
Let's break this down

we use range(x) to generate a list of numbers x numbers long.

the for i in statement iterates through the list, setting i to be equal to each element, then running the line below.

We've solved a super simple neural network! It takes no inputs and outputs a constant value of whatever our target is! If we train long enough we bring the cost to zero and our output to the desired value.

How interesting!!!!!!! Huh? No!?!?!? Well ok, you're right it's not that interesting.

In the next video we'll look at a neural network that takes an actual input and predicts an output!

126,UCrBzGHKmGDcwLFnQGHJ3XYg,Beginner Intro to Neural Networks 6: Slope of the Cost Function,Gvq9sUHPgrc,"In this video things get a bit more interactive!

We use three different techniques to find the slope of our cost function.

The first is a numerical approximation (not the best by any means, but works for quick illustrative purposes). We divide a change in our functions output by the change in its input, and the smaller the change in input (h) the better the approximation.

The second way we find the slope is by just expanding the definition of the slope using our current function. After simplification and dropping h as it goes to zero, we end up with a simple function that looks very similar to the original cost function. This is the true derivative of our cost function. 

Finally we see a quick trick from calculus, the power rule, that helps us find the derivative. We bring the exponent out front and multiply by it, and decrement the original exponent by 1. 

NOTE! I left out a second step to be brief in the video, but you have to remember to differentiate the stuff inside parenthesis as well with respect to b. -4 is a constant so it becomes 0, and the derivative of b with respect to b (think of the graph of b as b changes, what's its slope? 1!) is 1. You have to multiply this by your original power rule expression, so the total derivative becomes 2*(b-4)*1 which is the same as 2 * (b-4). Thanks to Mohamed H. Guelleh in the comments for making me realize I shouldn't leave out these steps regardless of whether the derivative is the same. We'll see this property more later when we have a neural network in place of b. 

Thanks for watching! I'm trying out some interactive stuff in the animation program, that lets me evaluate simple expressions and slide numbers around. I hope it all makes sense enough!

It gives us a way to measure how bad our neural net's predictions are, and is also the first step towards improving those predictions.

It takes as input our networks predictions, and what they should be from the data. 

Before looking at the larger cost function for our farmer's example, we look at a simple visualization first.

We can graph the cost of a super simple neural network as we change its only parameter. It's zero when our network's output is what we want, and positive everywhere else. 

To minimize the cost we need to change our net's parameter, b. We can see that when b is less than our target value, the slope of the cost function is negative. When b is more than our target value, the slope is positive. To push b in the right direction, we SUBTRACT the slope of the cost function at b from b. We subtract a fraction because if we used the actual slope we may overshoot our target and oscillate wildly out of the parabola.

This is the essence of backpropagation. In other words, we take the derivative of the cost function with respect to the parameter, which tells us how the cost changes when we change the parameter (if the derivative is 1, that implies when we increase the parameter the cost will increase, if its -1, when we increase the parameter the cost will decrease). The derivative tells us a change to the parameters that will cause a maximum increase in the cost, so instead of adding it we subtract it, causing the cost to decrease. 

In the next video we'll see how to derive a function that tells us the slope of our cost function at any b, using only the definition of the slope of a function.

1. Types of Recurrent Models:
Simple MLPs, time-synchronous models, output-at-end models, order-synchronous intermittent-output models, and delayed output models offer various approaches for analyzing time series data or sequences.

2. MLP Model:
Utilizes regular MLPs to analyze time series data, treating each instance in the series separately and defining divergence between sequence outputs and target outputs for training.

3. Time-synchronous Model:
Outputs an output for each input, suitable for tasks like stock prediction or part-of-speech tagging. Assumes one output per input and calculates divergence between actual and desired output sequences for training.

4. Output-at-end Model:
Produces output after analyzing the entire input sequence, commonly used in tasks like word recognition or sentiment analysis. Divergence is considered only at the final input but can be extended to consider intermediate outputs as well.

5. Order-synchronous Intermittent Output Model:
Generates intermittent outputs corresponding to segments of the input sequence, as seen in speech recognition. Involves concatenating output-at-end models, but inference requires selecting the most likely compressed sequence.

6. Training Approaches:
Training the intermittent-output model involves aligning target outputs to input sequences, either by guessing alignments or considering all alignments. Alignment defines specific times for output symbols' production and can be represented through the expansion or compression of sequences.

7. Training by Guessing the Alignment:
Initiate alignment guesses, train the model, compute divergence between aligned target sequences and actual outputs, re-estimate alignments, and iterate until convergence. Alternatively, consider all alignments for more robust training.

By understanding and utilizing these recurrent model variants and training approaches, one can effectively analyze and process time series data or sequences in various applications.",2024-03-13T23:15:01Z,207,3,0,false,PT1H24M24S,0
142,UC8hYZGEkI2dDO8scT8C5UQA,IDL Spring 2024: Lecture 15,6wjbgUzELls,"Output-at-end model
----The ""output-at-end"" model produces an output after the entire input sequence is analyzed
----The output is produced at the final output
--------E.g. isolated word recognition, question answering, or sentiment analysis
--------In fact, there are outputs at each input, but we ignore all but the final output
----To train the output-at-end model, we must consider the divergence at the output, i.e. at the final input
--------However, this ignores the intermediate (ignored) outputs also produced by the network
---- A more profitable approach to training is to assume that the intermediate outputs too must match the target output, and to minimize the total divergence over all inputs.
----This effectively converts the output-at-end model to a time-synchronous model
----The order-synchronous intermittent output model
----The order-synchronous intermittent-output model produces outputs intermittently
----E.g. in speech recognition, where input may be hundreds or thousands of spectral vectors, but the output is only a much small sequence of words or phonemes
----Each output symbol corresponds to a segment of the input.  The output symbols occur in the same order as the input segments they correspond to, but the length of the segment associated with any input varies from segment to segment.
----The order-synchronous, intermittent-output model is just a concatenation of several output-at-end models
----But this simple extension creates complications
----Given an input sequence, at inference time it is unknown how many outputs must be produced and at what times
----Inference must select the most likely ""compressed"" order-synchronous sequence (sequence of symbols of any length less than or equal to the length of the input sequence), given the input
----This is not the same as selecting the most likely time-synchronous output that has one output for every input
----The greedy algorithm for inference simply selects the most probable output at each time and merges repetitions
----The actual output is produced at the sequence of repeating outputs
----This cannot, however, distinguish between actual repetitions of output and a simple sequence of repeating outputs that must be merged
----This also actually outputs the most probable time-synchronous sequence, and not the most probable order-synchronous sequence.
----Training the intermittent-output model is simple if the alignment of the target outputs is known for the training inputs
----The ""alignment"" of the output to the input explicitly states at which times of the input each output symbol is produced
----We can now just sum the divergences at the individual aligned output times
----Alternately we can replicate the target output symbol for each aligned output over the entire segment of inputs it represents
----This converts it to a time-synchronous model
----The divergence is now defined as the sum of local divergences between the actual and target outputs at every time
----In reality, for intermittent-output problems such as speech recognition, the training data does not usually include the alignment of the output sequence to the input
----Only provides input sequence and target output sequence
----Possible solutions:
----Guess the alignments of training instances
----Consider all alignments
Defining the alignment
----The ""alignment"" of an order-synchronous sequence to an input sequence indicates the specific times at which the symbols in the output sequence are produced
----This can also be represented by repeating the symbols in the order-synchronous sequences over the segment of input it corresponds to
----This converts the order-synchronous sequence to a time-synchronous sequence
----The time-synchronous sequence obtained by repeating symbols in the order-synchronous sequence is an ""expansion"" of the order-synchronous sequence
----The order synchronous sequence can be recovered from the time-synchronous sequence by eliminating repetitions
----This is a ""compression"" of the time-synchronous sequence
----An order-synchronous sequence can be expanded into a time-synchronous sequence in many ways

- (RNNs are good not just for time-series problems, but also for other nominally MLP problems with sequential structure
- - For example an MLP that adds two binary numbers will require a very large number of neurons and potentially an exponential number of training instances but can be implemented using a tiny RNN that needs only a tiny number of training samples
- - E.g. an MLP for parity check requires a large number of neurons and an exponential number of training instances, but an RNN for the same task is tiny and requires minimal training instances.
- RNNs must ideally be BIBO-stable
- - A sequence of bounded inputs must result in a bounded sequence of outputs
- - More generally, the output must not saturate or blow up
- - In memory terms -- the network must retain memory about key patterns in the input arbitrarily long until is no longer relevant
The stability/instability of the recurrent network is a function of its recurrent hidden layer, so it is sufficient to analyze it.
- Analyzing the recurrent layer we find:
- - For recurrence with linear activation (in the hidden layer), the ability of the network to ""remember"" an input depends only on the Eigenvalues of the recurrent weight matrix
- - - If the largest Eigenvalue is greater than 1, the output of the network will blow up
- - - If the largest Eigenvalue is less than 1, the output of the network will quickly ""die"" to 0
- - - Even if the largest Eigenvalues are exactly 1,  the network will only ""remember"" the corresponding Eigenvector, and not the actual input it is supposed to remember
- For nonlinear activations, the recurrent activations will ""stabilize"" at a value that only depends on the recurrent weights and bias
- - More explicitly, on the Eigenvalues of W
- - Recurrence with Sigmoid activations quickly saturates to their stable value which only depends on weights matrix W and bias b, but not on the input.
- - Recurrence with Tanh activations too quickly saturates to a value that depends only on W and b
- - - But tanh activations take longer to saturate, effectively giving us a greater ""memory"" time
- - - This is why we generally use tanh activations in recurrent nets
- - Relu activations result in blowing up or ""dying"" of the recurrent value and do not represent the input
- For deep networks, we also see the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients during training
- - Backpropagation is a chain of multiplications of Jacobians and Weight matrices
- - Very few singular values are greater than 1,  most if not all of them will be less than 1
- - As a result, for deep networks, gradients will shrink during backpropagation and eventually vanish
- - - Except for a very small number of directions (with singular values greater than 1) where they will blow up
- - Recurrent networks are very deep networks that also have the same problems in training
- Recurrent networks thus have two problems:  they have poor ""memory""  and derivatives do not travel well in the backward pass. Both problems arise because forward/backward signals are distorted or diminished by the recurrent weights and activations.
- The ideal behavior for a recurrent network is where information stored in their recurrent ""memory"" is retained arbitrarily long until they are no longer required
""released"" by patterns detected in the input
- Such behavior can be obtained by eliminating the recurrent weights and activations in the network
- Memory contents must be modified through explicit pattern detectors that analyze the input
- The actual recurrent state is obtained by branching the memory of and separately applying an activation to it
- This architecture gives us the ""Long Short-Term Memory"" (LSTM) neurons

- The overall cell takes in 3 values -- an input, a CEC value, and a hidden state -- and outputs 2 values: a CEC value and a hidden state.
- The LSTM network is composed similarly to RNNs, with LSTM cells replacing the recurrent units of a conventional RNN.
- They can be incorporated into both one-sided and bi-directional networks.
- Backpropagation through an LSTM can be complex and is most conveniently performed through code: by computing derivatives for each of the forward operations in the cell, in reverse order.
- Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) simplify LSTM cells by eliminating some computations
- A single gate replaces the input and forgets gates
- The cell only computes the raw CEC value, instead of both the CEC and hidden state.  The CEC value is transformed through an activation, before using it for input pattern detection.",2024-03-01T18:56:19Z,410,7,0,false,PT1H26M51S,0

- Time-series data, where the sequence of past inputs carries information about the current inference,  require models that consider past values when making the current prediction
- Models that look into a finite past are simply 1D-CNNs
- To look into the infinite past we need recurrence
- The simplest recurrence considers past outputs along with current inputs
- - This ensures that an input affects the output for the indefinite future.
- - These are NARX networks
- Models can also hold the memory of the past internally (rather than through the output)
- - Older ""partially recurrent"" models stored them through intermediate ""memory"" variables
- - - Jordan networks use a memory neuron that retains a running average of outputs
- - - Elman networks clone the hidden layer of the network as a memory unit
- ""Fully recurrent"" networks are state-space models, with a recurrent state.
- - The ""state"" may be arbitrarily complex
- - These networks are called ""Recurrent Neural Networks"" (or ""RNNs"")
- An RNN can be ""unrolled"" over time into a chain of identical ""columns"" of computation
- - This essentially forms a very deep shared-parameter network
- To train an RNN we must compute the divergence between the sequence of outputs by the network and the desired sequence of outputs
- - This is not necessarily the sum of the divergences at individual time instants.
- - We will nevertheless need the derivative of the divergence w.r.t. the output of the network at each time instant
- Backpropagation starts at the final output and derivatives are propagated backward through time
- - At each time, loss derivatives for the output at that time are backpropagated and accumulated with derivatives coming backward from later in the sequence
- - Derivative rules for shared-parameter networks apply
- Recurrence can be extended to be bi-directional in cases where sequential (left-to-right) processing is not expected
- Bi-directional networks include ""bi-directional blocks"", which have two components (subnets), one of which analyzes the input left to right (forward net), and the other analyzes it right to the left (reverse net). 
- - The outputs of the two components are concatenated to produce the output of the block
- - During training, the appropriate components of the derivatives at the output of the bidirectional block are ""sent"" to the individual components
- - - Backpropagation is performed end to beginning for the forward net and from the beginning to the end for the reverse net
- - - The backpropagated derivatives at the inputs to the two subnets are added to form the backpropagated derivative at the input to the block",2024-02-29T00:00:10Z,391,7,0,false,PT1H28M10S,0

- How to perform backprop over a pooling layer
- - Backprop over maxpooling
- - Backprop over meanpooling
- - - This is basically a channel-wise convolution with a uniform filter
- How to perform backprop over resampling layers
- - Backprop over downsampling is upsampling
- - Backprop over upsampling is downsampling
- - Backprop must always ensure that the size of the loss derivative going backwards is the same as the size of the input to the operation
- Convolution and pooling with stride are best thought of as convolution/pooling followed by downsampling for the purpose of backprop
- Even with up/downsampling,  backprop can be implemented simply by modifying forward code by reversing the order of computation in the loops and replacing each forward operation with its derivative counterparts
- CNNs are shift/position invariant pattern detectors, not transform invariant.
- - Transform invariance can be achieved by explicitly making transformed copies of the filters before convolving with them
- - Backprop rules must be modified for parameter sharing between the original filter and its transformed variant.
- CNNs only answer the question ""Does this input contain pattern X"" (e.g. does it contain a flower). To find the flower's actual location, we must add an additional output layer to predict the corners of the object's bounding box.
- - Training must now include multiple losses, one from the bounding box predictor and one from the classification output layer.
- - The same mechanism can be extended to, e.g., draw the skeleton/stick figure of a walking person
- Depth-wise convolution is a convolution variant where individual input channels are separately filtered
- - As opposed to being jointly filtered, as happens in regular convolutions
- - N input channels result in N output channels
- - The convolved channels are then combined via 1x1 convolutions to get the final output

- - - C planes are smaller than their S planes
- - Only the S cells have learnable parameters; the C cells have fixed responses.
- - The model is trained through unsupervised Hebbian learning with a ""winner-take-all"" strategy.
- - Trained on digit images (unsupervised), it automatically learns a hierarchy of features that compose the individual digits.
- Yann Lecunn's added supervision to the Fukushima model to compose the ""Convolutional"" network.
- A convolutional network comprises

- - - Scanning with a single neuron instead of explicitly making many copies of it
- - - Each convolutional layer comprises a bank of ""filters"", each of which jointly scans all the maps in the previous layer to compose an affine map
- - - The elements of the affine map are put through an activation function to produce the activation map (one per filter)
- - ""Pooling"" layers that correspond to Fukushima's ""C"" planes
- - - Scanning each activation map with a ""pooling"" operation
- - - Pooling operation could be a max, a mean, or a learned function
- - ""Resampling"" layers that change the size of the maps by dropping elements to decrease their size or inserting zeros to increase them
- - - Downsampling (dropping elements) usually follows a convolution or pooling and is generally merged with the preceding operation to result in convolution or pooling with a stride
- - - Upsampling (introducing zeros) precedes convolution
- - A ""flatten"" operation that reorders the output of the final convolution/pooling layer
- - An MLP that operates on the output of the flatten to perform classification
- The parameters of the model are
- - The number of filters (Kernels) in each layer, their size, and the stride of convolution,  
- - The size of the pooling filters and their strides
- - The parameters of the final MLP
- All parameters of the network can be learned through backpropagation.",2024-02-16T18:30:22Z,476,13,0,false,PT1H18M49S,0

- Position-invariant pattern recognition tasks requiring such as ""Does this picture have a flower"", or ""Does this recording include the word welcome"" are best performed by scanning for the pattern
- - ""Position/shift-invariant"" - only matters that the target pattern occurred in the input, but not where it occurred in it.
- - Scanning will result in one classification output for every position scanned.
- - The final decision must combine the outputs for every position, e.g. by taking the max, softmax, or putting them through an MLP.
- Scanning and combining the outputs (at different scan positions) is mathematically identical to analyzing the entire input with a large ""shared-parameter"" network
- - It is equivalent to having identical subnets that analyze the different blocks of the input
- - Gradient-computation rules must be modified to account for shared parameters:  the derivatives computed individually for the shared parameters must be added. 
- Instead of scanning the entire input with a complete network, we can reorder the computation to scan the input with only the first-layer neurons, and subsequently scan the outputs of lower-layer neurons with higher-layer neurons
- - The final outcome will not change
- Instead of having the entire network analyze an entire input block, the scanning can be distributed over the layers of the network
- - The lowest layer scans the input in small blocks and its outputs are arranged in the same positional pattern as the corresponding input blocks.
- - Each subsequent layer scans blocks of the outputs of the previous layer (and its outputs are arranged in the positional patterns of its input blocks).
- - Each layer effectively ""views"" increasingly large regions of the original input.
- Scanning inputs in this manner is called ""Convolution"" and the network is a ""Convolutional Neural Network"".
- Convolutional neural networks with hierarchical/distributed representations need far fewer parameters than a non-hierarchical model.
- They also need far less computation by being able to reuse computation across different positions of the scan.
      
Terminology and additional detail:
- Each of the neurons in a layer is called a ""filter"" or kernel, and its output may be called a ""Channel""
- The region of the input ""viewed"" by a neuron is its ""receptive field""
- Jitter-invariance in input patterns can be obtained by ""max pooling"" (or generally pooling), where the neuron simply outputs the largest inputs.
- 1-D scanning versions of the model are sometimes called ""Time-delay neural networks""",2024-02-12T16:30:00Z,449,7,0,false,PT1H25M17S,0

It covers the following topics
-The choice of divergence (loss) function can affect your training
--Ideally, the loss must be bowl-shaped w.r.t. parameters 
--For classification problems, the KL divergence is convex w.r.t. the weights of the output layer, whereas the L2 divergence is not convex
-We learned about several key procedures needed for better optimization and generalization:

Batchnormalization:
- At any neuron,  minibatches of inputs can have a statistical ""covariate shift"" with respect to other minibatches
 --Making them unrepresentative of the overall distribution of data
- Batch normalization handles this by ""standardizing"" the minibatches at each neuron.
        By moving all minibatches to a common location in the space
        This is done by
            First ""centering"" the minibatch at the origin and normalizing its variance to 1, and
            Scaling the minibatch and moving it to a new, neuron-specific location in the space
            The scaling factor and location are neuron-specific BN parameters
    Backpropagation (derivative) rules must be modified to account for Batch normalization
        Because, due to normalization, every instance in a minibatch contributes to the normalized value of any instance in the minibatch.
        Modification is required both to actually account for the normalization in computing derivatives and to estimate the neuron-specific BN parameters
        We learned how to derive the derivative rules for BN using influence diagrams
    The mean and variance used to ""center"" test data must be estimated from the training minibatches

     Regularization:

    -In the absence of other constraints, a model can easily learn to match the local patterns of the training data instead of the underlying global trends
    -- ""Overfitting""
    -- This can happen because the weights of the neuron can grow in an uncontrolled manner, permitting the network output to change steeply with input.
 -This can be controlled by adding a ""regularization"" term to the loss, that encourages network weights to be small (i.e. to have low L2 norm).
    -- This gives us the ""weight decay"" heuristic in gradient descent.
    -- The network can also be regularized by making it deeper, rather than wider

     Dropout:

    -Dropout randomly ""deletes"" (sets to 0) neurons in the network, with some probability α during training
        --In principle, it emulates bagging over all possible networks, obtained by sub-selecting neurons in an N-neuron network.
    --It forces neurons to learn ""denser"", and thus more informative features.
    -To account for dropout in training, the outputs of neurons must be scaled by α during inference
        - This is actually an approximation to the expectation over all bagged networks
        - There are multiple ways of actually implementing this, including pre-scaling network weights, or scaling down neuron outputs during train

     Gradient clipping:

 Gradient clipping caps the magnitude of derivatives during training, to prevent instability in training.

    Data augmenation:

    Data augmentation generates synthetic training instances by distorting actual training samples, to expand the training set.",2024-02-07T16:10:14Z,412,12,0,false,PT1H28M31S,0

In this lecture, we will cover the following topics:
-Vanilla gradient descent attempts to reduce the divergence at all training instances at once (""Batch"" updates).
- - This is the ""correct"" thing to do that reduces error everywhere
- - But requires us to process the entire training data for each update
- Stochastic gradient descent is an incremental variant that updates the parameters of the model after each training instance
- - You get many more updates of the model for each pass through the training data (epoch)
- For SGD to converge it requires:
- - The order in which training samples are processed to be randomized in each pass through the training data, to prevent cyclic or suboptimal updates.
- - Learning rates must shrink with iterations
- - - Shrink slowly enough that in the limit the learning rates sum to infinity to enable the algorithm to find even solutions that may be very far away from the initial estimate.
- - - Yet fast enough that the sum of their squares is finite, to ensure that the algorithm converges.
- - - The ideal learning rate should shrink as 1/k
- SGD updates can converge much faster than batch updates, but the resulting model may be much poorer
- - Also have much greater variance in performance
- - This is because the SGD loss function has high variance
- - - Each training sample's individual loss function is different
- - - Since the model is updated after each training instance, each update optimizes a different loss function
- Mini-batch updates strike a compromise by updating over sets of samples (""Mini-batches"")
- - Mini-batch loss has much lower variance than SGD loss
- - - Approaching the actual training-set loss in the limit
- - Yet we get many more updates per pass through the training data
- - The performance obtained can match full-batch training in accuracy and variance,  in convergence time comparable to SGD
- Momentum methods, including vanilla momentum and Nesterov's method can further improve -convergence, by smoothing out the gradient steps.
- - These will smooth out oscillatory variations in the gradient
- RMSprop improves convergence by adapting the learning rate for each component in inverse proportion to the total movement of that component
- - These will reduce learning rates for components with oscillatory swings while maintaining or enhancing them for components with consistent behavior
- - In the limit, it will act like RProp
- ADAM and its variants combine the smoothed gradient of momentum with the adaptive learning rate of RMSprop.",2024-02-06T18:00:50Z,404,9,0,false,PT1H10M3S,0

In this lecture, we will cover the following topics:
- Minimizing the loss function composed of divergences may not actually find solutions that do exist.
- - The minimum of the loss function may not be at the parameters that actually minimize the error. 
- - E.g.,  in the case of a simple perceptron, even when a linear classifier exists, loss minimization may not find it, even though the perceptron algorithm can find it.
- - This may be a feature, and not a bug, as it reduces the variance of the estimated model.
- Gradient descent may converge to a minimum, oscillate, or even diverge away from the solution depending on the step-size parameter.
- The optimal step size (and the range of convergent) step sizes for gradient-descent minimization depend on the ""curvature"" of the function being minimized.
- - For quadratic functions, the optimal stepsize is the inverse of the second derivative, and the convergent range is between 0 and twice the optimal value.
- - Step sizes outside the convergent range can cause gradient descent to diverge.
- For multivariate functions (like the network loss), the curvature will be different along different dimensions (parameters)
- - The optimal step size along one dimension may be divergent along another
- - To ensure convergence, the step size must be small enough to be convergent along every dimension
- - This may cause the overall convergence to become very slow
- The loss function is complex and has many saddle points and local minima.
- - Gradient descent may get stuck in poor local minima
- It is better to actually initially have a divergent step size and reduce it gradually
- - This makes it more likely to find a deeper minimum.
- - Several ""schedules"" exist for lowering the step size with iterations
- Part of the problems with convergence is because gradient descent assigns the same step size to all dimensions (parameters)
- Better techniques decouple the dimensions
- - Rprop uses only the sign of the derivative along each dimension to increase or decrease the update step.
- - - Increasing it when the sign stays consistent and decreasing it when the sign of the derivative changes between iterations
- - Quickprop uses a finite difference approximation of the second derivative to compute step size.
- Momentum methods correct for oscillatory behavior of updates by smoothing out update steps to speed up convergence.
- - Momentum maintains a running average of gradients along each dimension
- - Nesterov's method does the same but factors in the gradient at the predicted next position",2024-01-31T17:37:00Z,527,11,0,false,PT1H25M11S,1

1. Neural networks are parametric functions

    - Their parameters are the weights and biases of the neurons

2. While as universal approximators neural networks can approximate any function, to actually do so, their parameters must be appropriately chosen for it

  -  ""Learning"" the network to model a function.

3. In principle, we must learn the network parameters such that we minimize the cumulative error between the target function we are trying to model and the network.

    - In practice, we do not know the target function and only know its output at a finite number of samples (training instances).

4. We must estimate the network to minimize the error between the network output and the known output of the target function at these training samples. 

    - The ""empirical error""

5. The usual error metric of ""does the network predict the correct class"" can only be minimized for a single perceptron but leads to an unsolvable combinatorial optimization problem for larger networks

    - Even if the network structure is sufficient to perfectly classify the data
    - This is because small variations in network parameters do not change the total error.
    - This gives us no hint about which way to adjust parameters to improve the (classification of the) network.
        - (Hidden slides): An early attempt at heuristic approaches to solving this problem was the ADALINE and MADALINE algorithms.
            - These introduced the now-famous delta rule
            - But do not scale up to large neural networks

6. Instead, we replace the output neuron/layer of the network with a logistic/softmax function which computes the probability for the classes

    - Instead of performing hard classification

7. We define a differentiable continuously varying divergence function between the output of the network and the desired class output, which increases or decreases as network parameters are adjusted

    - Ideally increasing if the adjustments make the network worse, and decreasing if they make it better (i.e a better match of the target function)

8. The network can, in principle be trained by minimizing the expected divergence over the entire input space.
9. In practice, since we do not have the entire target function, but only a set of (training) samples drawn from it, we compute a ""loss"" function as the average divergence over the training samples.

    - The ""Empirical risk""

10. We estimate the network parameters to minimize this loss.

The Atomic Cannon, at 280 mm, was the largest nuclear weapons capable mobile artillery piece manufactured by the United States. On May 25, 1953, a 280 mm cannon fired an atomic projectile a distance of 7 miles at the Nevada Test Site. The test known as ""Grable,"" exploded with a force of 15 kilotons, similiar to that of Hiroshima. Twenty 280 mm cannons were manufactured. None were used in battle. Sequence from the HD version of ""Trinity and Beyond - The Atomic Bomb Movie"" available on blu-ray.

In late April 1945, diplomats, journalists and photographers converged on San Francisco for the founding session of the United Nations.  As stock footage for a documentary about this historic meeting, government cinematographers took the footage seen here.  Like so many visitors to San Francisco, they were particularly drawn to the city's cable car system.
Though the war in Europe was nearly done, in April 1945 the war in the Pacific was still being fought.  You'll see many men and women in uniform in these films.  And the cable cars are jammed, and not with tourists.
Scenes in this video:
0:18 Taken with a telephoto lens looking west from the intersection of Broadway and Taylor.  Our Lady of Guadalupe Church is at the bottom of the hill.
0:41 The first in a series of shots taken from various points at the intersection of Pine and Jones Streets.  This is the long-gone O'Farrell-Jones-Hyde Street line where it turned briefly east-west between Jones and Hyde Streets.
2:20 A beautiful afternoon shot looking west on California Street.
2:37 A series of shots at the busy intersection of Powell and California where the two lines cross.
This is part of a large batch of films that the National Archives just digitized this year, and image quality is superb.
The original film is silent, so I've added a music track.  This time it's Igor Stravinsky, who will not be to everybody's taste, but is appropriate if for no other reason than he was living in California at the time.",2020-09-21T13:00:00Z,16563,319,0,false,PT5M,83

RDS-37 was the Soviet Union's first two-stage hydrogen bomb, first tested on November 22, 1955. The weapon had a nominal yield of approximately 3 megatons. It was scaled down to 1.6 megatons for the live test.

It was a multi-stage thermonuclear device which utilized radiation implosion called Sakharov's Third Idea in the USSR (the Teller–Ulam design in the USA). It utilized a fissile core containing Uranium-235 and synthetic Uranium-233, and a dry lithium deuteride fusion fuel, with some of it replaced with a ""passive material"" to reduce its total yield. Despite this reduction in yield, because the weapon exploded under an inversion layer much of its shock wave was focused back downward at the ground unexpectedly, causing a trench to collapse on a group of soldiers, killing one, and a building in Kurchatov, 65 km (40 mi) distant, to collapse and kill a young girl.

It was air-dropped at Semipalatinsk Test Site, Kazakhstan, making it the first air-dropped two-stage thermonuclear test. The RDS-6s device (Joe-4) exploded in 1953 had one-stage design, and was not scalable into the megaton yield range.",2020-09-19T20:57:44Z,279114,3460,0,false,PT2M31S,449

Stooging could be a hazardous profession...

In ""Gem of a Jam"" (1943), the table Curly's on tilts too fast and his head hits the window sill.
The gash required nine stitches.  He immediately returned to work.

""Heavenly Daze"" (1939) director Jules White assured Moe that a pen gag wouldn't hurt Larry.  
It did.  The pen deeply punctured Larry's forehead, and Moe took off after White. 

Ironically, Moe sustained the most on-set injuries.

A blast of gunk to the face in ""Oily to Bed, Oily to Rise"" (1939) required medical attention to Moe's eyes.

In ""Self-Made Maids"" (1950), a twisted ankle has Moe diving out of camera range to save the shot.

This film examines life after the roaring 1920s and into the devastating decade of the 30s. President Herbert Hoover, unable to deal with the great depression and the overproduction crisis, is replaced by Franklin D. Roosevelt who puts in action a new program  - the New Deal - which promises to end poverty and unemployment.
Meanwhile, demagogues, such as senator Huey Long, command wide networks of supporters and are willing to take forceful action....
The film ends with FDR's reelection with a landslide in 1936 with the greatest political sweep in history.

This is where Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) saves the day. Long Short-Term Memory is a type of recurrent neural network that can handle much larger sequences of data without those pesky exploding/vanishing gradient problems that plague basic recurrent neural networks.

However, if you have a lot of options, things get out of hand quickly. This is where methods like Target Encoding really start to shine, so that's what we'll talk about today.

From the first statistics class I took that was terrible, but then he taught me about linear models to how he trained me not to guess and to always look for a better way.

It's also surprisingly simple, but often poorly explained. Traditionally the equation is presented with the expectation that you memorize it without thoroughly understanding what it means and where it came from. This video takes a very different approach by showing you, step-by-step, where this simple equation comes from, making it easy to remember (and derive), understand and explain to your friends at parties.

2:24 Overview of how t-SNE works
4:12 Step 1: Determine high-dimensional similarities
9:26 Step 2: Determine low-dimensional similarities
10:33 Step 3: Move points in low-d
11:05 Why the t-distribution is used instead of the normal distribution

Corrections:
6:17 I should have said that the blue points have twice the density of the purple points. 
7:08 There should be a 0.05 in the denominator, not a 0.5.

It can be used to identify patterns in highly complex datasets and it can tell you what variables in your data are the most important. Lastly, it can tell you how accurate your new understanding of the data actually is.

In this video, I go one step at a time through PCA, and the method used to solve it, Singular Value Decomposition. I take it nice and slowly so that the simplicity of the method is revealed and clearly explained.

If you are interested in doing PCA in R see: https://youtu.be/0Jp4gsfOLMs

Correction:
4:06 I say that the difference in fits between the training dataset and the testing dataset is called Variance. However, I should have said that the difference is a _consequence_ of variance. Technically, variance refers to the amount by which the predictions would change if we fit the model to a different training data set.

10:28 - The larger scale
14:45 - Dirichlet’s theorem
20:26 - Why care?

Corrections:
18:30: In the video, I say that Dirichlet showed that the primes are equally distributed among allowable residue classes, but this is not historically accurate.  (By ""allowable"", here, I mean a residue class whose elements are coprime to the modulus, as described in the video).  What he actually showed is that the sum of the reciprocals of all primes in a given allowable residue class diverges, which proves that there are infinitely many primes in such a sequence.

Dirichlet observed this equal distribution numerically and noted this in his paper, but it wasn't until decades later that this fact was properly proved, as it required building on some of the work of Riemann in his famous 1859 paper.  If I'm not mistaken, I think it wasn't until Vallée Poussin in (1899), with a version of the prime number theorem for residue classes like this, but I could be wrong there.

In many ways, this was a very silly error for me to have let through.  It is true that this result was proven with heavy use of complex analysis, and in fact, it's in a complex analysis lecture that I remember first learning about it.  But of course, this would have to have happened after Dirichlet because it would have to have happened after Riemann!

My apologies for the mistake.  If you notice factual errors in videos that are not already mentioned in the video's description or pinned comment, don't hesitate to let me know.

Reducible video on FFTs
https://youtu.be/h7apO7q16V0

Veritasium video on FFTs
https://youtu.be/nmgFG7PUHfo

A small correction for the integer multiplication algorithm mentioned at the end. A “straightforward” application of FFT results in a runtime of O(N * log(n) log(log(n)) ). That log(log(n)) term is tiny, but it is only recently in 2019, Harvey and van der Hoeven found an algorithm that removed that log(log(n)) term.

Another small correction at 17:00. I describe O(N^2) as meaning ""the number of operations needed scales with N^2"". However, this is technically what Theta(N^2) would mean. O(N^2) would mean that the number of operations needed is at most constant times N^2, in particular, it includes algorithms whose runtimes don't actually have any N^2 term, but which are bounded by it. The distinction doesn't matter in this case, since there is an explicit N^2 term.

On the topic, I can't help also mentioning another paradox book I'm rather fond of by Bunch:
https://amzn.to/3mBDSKE

Another video on Bayes' theorem:
https://youtu.be/HZGCoVF3YvM

*As mentioned in the on-screen note at the end, while the terms ""Bayes Factor"" and ""Likelihood Ratio"" refer to the same ratio in this setting, where Bayes rule is used on the probability of an event with only two possible outcomes (you either have the disease or you don't), they do take on divergent meanings in more general contexts.  Namely, if you have a continuous parameter you are trying to estimate, the two terms reflect two alternate approaches you can use in comparing hypotheses.  In fact, some people take the phrase ""Bayes factor"" to _specifically_ refer to its use in this more continuous context.

If you want more details, Wikipedia actually has a really nice example discussing the difference:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor#Example

This post has some nice discussion of the distinction:

Many of you shared solutions, attempts, and simulations with me this last week.  I loved it!  You all are the best.  Here are just two of my favorites.
By a channel STEM cell: https://youtu.be/ils7GZqp_iE
By Doga Kurkcuoglu: http://bilimneguzellan.net/bouncing-cubes-and-%CF%80-3blue1brown/

And here's a lovely interactive built by GitHub user prajwalsouza after watching this video: https://prajwalsouza.github.io/Experiments/Colliding-Blocks.html

NY Times blog post about this problem:
https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/pi/

The original paper by Gregory Galperin:
https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf

For anyone curious about if the tan(x) ≈ x approximation, being off by only a cubic error term, is actually close enough not to affect the final count, take a look at sections 9 and 10 of Galperin's paper.  In short, it could break if there were some point where among the first 2N digits of pi, the last N of them were all 9's.  This seems exceedingly unlikely, but it quite hard to disprove.

Although I found the approach shown in this video independently, after the fact I found that Gary Antonick, who wrote the Numberplay blog referenced above, was the first to solve it this way.  In some ways, I think this is the most natural approach one might take given the problem statement, as corroborated by the fact that many solutions people sent my way in this last week had this flavor.  The Galperin solution you will see in the next video, though, involves a wonderfully creative perspective.

Thanks to Gordon' s Wine Bar for letting us film in their bar. Ha! It wasn't a dungeon, it was a wine bar all along! (An amazing wine bar at that; definitely visit it next time you're in London (and things are open again)). https://www.gordonswinebar.com/

Also: this was filmed back in February 2020 pre-coronavirus (at least before we knew about it). Which is why we're sat so close together and not wearing masks. And people are phoning a wine bar.

For those of you want it all, and you want it now, we've put the complete, unedited footage of Matt and Grant completing the puzzle scenario on Matt's second channel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEDZyK8UL6M

We'll put the deleted footage on the Stand-up Maths patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/posts/39003911

Sorry the audio is a bit hit and miss. Matt's microphone dropped out for a bit so we tried to rescue the audio from Grant's lapel mic. With some success.

Puzzle as emailed by Grant to Matt:
Prisoner 1 walks in, sees a chessboard where each square has a coin on top, flipped either to heads or tails.  The warden places the key under one of the squares, which prisoner 1 sees.  Before he leaves, he must turn over one and only one coin.  Prisoner 2 then walks in and is supposed to be able to figure out which squares the key is in just by looking at the arrangement of coins.

This is the website Matt mentioned with a full breakdown of the solution and interactive boards you can play with.
http://datagenetics.com/blog/december12014/index.html

CORRECTIONS:
- At 20:42 when I (Matt) said ""You're now assigning a 64-dimension..."" he meant to say ""You're now assigning a 6-dimension..."". But that is a moot point because Grant can visualise cubes in all dimension spaces with equal ease.
- At 24:20 I said Venn and Euler the wrong way around. No one tell Steve Mould!
- Let me know if you spot anything else.

14:45 - Dirichlet’s theorem
20:26 - Why care?

Corrections:
18:30: In the video, I say that Dirichlet showed that the primes are equally distributed among allowable residue classes, but this is not historically accurate.  (By ""allowable"", here, I mean a residue class whose elements are coprime to the modulus, as described in the video).  What he actually showed is that the sum of the reciprocals of all primes in a given allowable residue class diverges, which proves that there are infinitely many primes in such a sequence.

Dirichlet observed this equal distribution numerically and noted this in his paper, but it wasn't until decades later that this fact was properly proved, as it required building on some of the work of Riemann in his famous 1859 paper.  If I'm not mistaken, I think it wasn't until Vallée Poussin in (1899), with a version of the prime number theorem for residue classes like this, but I could be wrong there.

In many ways, this was a very silly error for me to have let through.  It is true that this result was proven with heavy use of complex analysis, and in fact, it's in a complex analysis lecture that I remember first learning about it.  But of course, this would have to have happened after Dirichlet because it would have to have happened after Riemann!

My apologies for the mistake.  If you notice factual errors in videos that are not already mentioned in the video's description or pinned comment, don't hesitate to let me know.

Honestly, given that the code for that video is meant for demo purposes, and not meant to reflect the true data of COVID-19, if you want to apply these ideas to the current situation I'd recommend looking for more professional epidemiological modeling tools that are less centered around animations and pedagogy and more focused on accurate predictions.  For example, the Institute for Disease Modeling has a lot of models free for people to look at and play with.

The specific figure is Figure 3, the last panel showing instant contact tracing (with an app). It shows what combination of % (symptomatic) cases isolated & % (pre/a-symptomatic) contacts quarantined would contain the virus or not.

Beautiful pictorial summary by @ThuyNganVu:
https://twitter.com/ThuyNganVu/status/1259288683489849344

Errors:
At minute 16, the sum should be written with a ""..."" to indicate going to infinity.
At minute 38, the exponent should have 1/(2s^2) instead of 1/s^2 for s to represent standard deviation.
At minute 54, an equal sign was mistakenly used in taking the derivative of x^3 / 3!.
At the end, it should be pointed out that the alternating series with x^n terms only converges for values of x between -1 and 1, so the values one can't be considered proven with values of x outside that range.  Everything with the argument here is fine, as it only deals with the convergent input, but that fact should still be mentioned.

Mistakes:
In the off-handed remarks on quaternions, I mentioned rotation in 4d would require 10 degrees of freedom.  That's wrong, what I should have said was it requires 6 degrees of freedom, and rotation in 5D is what requires 10 degrees of freedom.

Not on the ""homework"" to show that exp(x + y) = exp(x) * exp(y). This gets a little more intricate if you start asking seriously about whether the series really converge, what they converge to, and how exactly you define a product with infinitely many terms. For anyone curious about the technical details, what you would want to show is that the Cauchy Product of the series for exp(x) and exp(y) converges to the product of the values exp(x) and exp(y) for any particular x and y. That requires the Merten's Theorem.

There's a slight mistake at 13:33, where the angle should be arctan(1/2) = 26.565 degrees, not 30 degrees.  Arg!  If anyone asks, I was just...er...rounding to the nearest 10's.

Code for this video:
https://github.com/3b1b/videos/blob/master/_2020/sir.py

Honestly, given that the code for that video is meant for demo purposes, and not meant to reflect the true data of COVID-19, if you want to apply these ideas to the current situation I'd recommend looking for more professional epidemiological modeling tools that are less centered around animations and pedagogy and more focused on accurate predictions.  For example, the Institute for Disease Modeling has a lot of models free for people to look at and play with.

GET SMARTER SECTION

I expected the hardwood to be faster than the felt because the rotational moment of inertia when spinning around the center is 1/4th that of tipping on the edge.  I was wrong in this case, but I'm wondering if this would hold true on glass?

THANK YOU EVERYONE who helped reduce the data! Names at bottom of this description. Follow the SED subreddit and other stuff if you want to help with stuff like this in the future.  Here's the link and spreadsheet to see how we did this:

Excellent visualization of this kind of growth from Minutephysics and Aatish Bhatia:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc

Data source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/#case-tot-outchina

Some have (quite rightfully) commented on how you shouldn't look at the R^2 of linear regressions on cumulative data since even if the changes from one day to the next are completely random, the totals they add up to wouldn't be independent of each other.  Since the derivative of an exponential should also be an exponential, we could instead run the same test on the logarithms of the differences from day to day, which in this case gives R^2 = 0.91.

While this video uses COVID-19 as a motivating example, the main goal is simply a math lesson on exponentials and logistic curves.  If you're looking for a video more focused on COVID-19 itself, I'd recommend taking a look at this one from Osmosis: https://youtu.be/cFB_C2ieW5I

14:45 - Dirichlet’s theorem
20:26 - Why care?

Corrections:
18:30: In the video, I say that Dirichlet showed that the primes are equally distributed among allowable residue classes, but this is not historically accurate.  (By ""allowable"", here, I mean a residue class whose elements are coprime to the modulus, as described in the video).  What he actually showed is that the sum of the reciprocals of all primes in a given allowable residue class diverges, which proves that there are infinitely many primes in such a sequence.

Dirichlet observed this equal distribution numerically and noted this in his paper, but it wasn't until decades later that this fact was properly proved, as it required building on some of the work of Riemann in his famous 1859 paper.  If I'm not mistaken, I think it wasn't until Vallée Poussin in (1899), with a version of the prime number theorem for residue classes like this, but I could be wrong there.

In many ways, this was a very silly error for me to have let through.  It is true that this result was proven with heavy use of complex analysis, and in fact, it's in a complex analysis lecture that I remember first learning about it.  But of course, this would have to have happened after Dirichlet because it would have to have happened after Riemann!

My apologies for the mistake.  If you notice factual errors in videos that are not already mentioned in the video's description or pinned comment, don't hesitate to let me know.

I'm not sure where the perspective shown in this video originates.  I do know you can find it in Tristan Needham's excellent book ""Visual Complex Analysis"", but if anyone has a sense of the first occurrence of this intuition do feel free to share.  It's simple and natural enough, though, that it's probably a view which has been independently thought up many times over.

You'll notice that video has an added factor of 16 throughout, which is not here.  That's because they're only counting the collisions between blocks (well, balls in their case), and they're only counting to the point where the big block starts moving the other way.

And here's a lovely interactive built by GitHub user prajwalsouza after watching this video: https://prajwalsouza.github.io/Experiments/Colliding-Blocks.html

NY Times blog post about this problem:
https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/pi/

The original paper by Gregory Galperin:
https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf

For anyone curious about if the tan(x) ≈ x approximation, being off by only a cubic error term, is actually close enough not to affect the final count, take a look at sections 9 and 10 of Galperin's paper.  In short, it could break if there were some point where among the first 2N digits of pi, the last N of them were all 9's.  This seems exceedingly unlikely, but it quite hard to disprove.

Although I found the approach shown in this video independently, after the fact I found that Gary Antonick, who wrote the Numberplay blog referenced above, was the first to solve it this way.  In some ways, I think this is the most natural approach one might take given the problem statement, as corroborated by the fact that many solutions people sent my way in this last week had this flavor.  The Galperin solution you will see in the next video, though, involves a wonderfully creative perspective.

If you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then ""add subtitles/cc"".  I really appreciate those who do this, as it helps make the lessons accessible to more people.

Discussion on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/3Blue1Brown/comments/a2gqo0/but_why_is_a_spheres_surface_area_four_times_its/

The first proof goes back to Greek times, due to Archimedes, who was charmed by the fact that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of a cylinder encompassing it, and 2/3 the surface area as well (if you consider the caps).  Check out this video for another beautiful animation of that first proof:

Computers cannot directly understand words/text as they only deal with numbers. So we need to convert words into numbers.

In this video, we have discussed what Words Embedding is and what its uses are. Word Embedding is a powerful way to make computers understand the context behind the words. With the help of Word Embedding, computers can also understand the relationship between words or the context behind the words.

It stands for Long Short-Term Memory. The simple RNN has a problem that it cannot remember the context in a long sentence because it quickly loses information. And that is why Simple RNN has an only short-term memory.

LSTM has both long-term and short-term memory. It can store any contextual information for a long time. 

LSTM has 2 internal states. 
1.) Memory Cell State which acts as a long term memory
2.) Hidden State which acts as a short term memory

The main working components in LSTM are gates. There are 3 types of gates in LSTM:
1.) Forget Gate
2.) Input Gate
3.) Output Gate

Max Pooling in Convolutional Neural Network is an important part of the CNN Architecture, where it is used to reduce the dimension of the image and enhance the features of the image as well.

Reducing the dimension of the image reduces the computational cost and the number of operations required to process the image. And enhancing the features helps our model to detect and understand features easily.

Max Pooling works by using a filter as a sliding window and extracting the maximum value from that window. 

Max Pooling in Convolutional Neural Network can highly increase the performance of the Convolutional Neural Network.

The path of learning in mini-batch gradient descent is zig-zag, and not straight. Thus, some time gets wasted in moving in a zig-zag direction. Adam Optimizer increases the horizontal movement and reduced the vertical movement, thus making the zig-zag path straighter, and thus reducing the time taken to train the model.

Adam Optimizer is formed by the combination of two Optimizers in Deep Learning, which are Momentum Optimizer and RMSprop Optimizer. 

Thus Adam Optimizer is the most powerful optimizer in Deep Learning.

The concept of Adam Optimizer is difficult to understand. Thus in this video, I have done my best to provide you with a detailed Explanation of the Adam Optimizer.

Momentum Optimizer in Deep Learning is a technique that reduces the time taken to train a model. 

The path of learning in mini-batch gradient descent is zig-zag, and not straight. Thus, some time gets wasted in moving in a zig-zag direction. Momentum Optimizer in Deep Learning smooth out the zig-zag path and make it much more straighter, thus reducing the time taken to train the model.

Momentum Optimizer uses Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, which averages out the vertical movement and the net movement is mostly in the horizontal direction. Thus zig-zag path becomes straighter.

In this video, we will also understand what Exponentially Weighted Moving Average is, and thus this video is a full in-depth explanation of Momentum Optimizer in Deep Learning.

578,UCJFAF6IsaMkzHBDdfriY-yQ,Momentum Optimizer in Deep Learning | Explained in Detail,Vce8w1sy0e8,"In this video, we will understand in detail what is Momentum Optimizer in Deep Learning.

Momentum Optimizer in Deep Learning is a technique that reduces the time taken to train a model. 

The path of learning in mini-batch gradient descent is zig-zag, and not straight. Thus, some time gets wasted in moving in a zig-zag direction. Momentum Optimizer in Deep Learning smooth out the zig-zag path and make it much more straighter, thus reducing the time taken to train the model.

Momentum Optimizer uses Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, which averages out the vertical movement and the net movement is mostly in the horizontal direction. Thus zig-zag path becomes straighter.

In this video, we will also understand what Exponentially Weighted Moving Average is, and thus this video is a full in-depth explanation of Momentum Optimizer in Deep Learning.

579,UCJFAF6IsaMkzHBDdfriY-yQ,Exponentially Weighted Moving Average or Exponential Weighted Average | Deep Learning,XV1f_srZg_E,"Exponentially Weighted Moving Average or Exponential Weighted Average is a very important concept to understand Optimization in Deep Learning.

It means that as we move forward, we simultaneously calculate the average of the points.

In Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, we consider few points, calculate its approximate weighted average, and then plot the graph. Then consider the next point as we move forward in time, calculate its approximate weighted average of the new set of points, and then again plot the graph and so on.

The catch here is that we are calculating the weighted average, and it means that, we give more weight to some points and less weight to the others.

Optimization in Deep Learning like Momentum, RMSProp, Adam can only be implemented with the help of Exponentially Weighted Moving Average. Thus it is very important to understand it.

In the video, we also understood what is Bias Correction and how to implement Bias Correction in Exponentially Weighted Moving Average.

580,UCJFAF6IsaMkzHBDdfriY-yQ,Mini Batch Gradient Descent | Deep Learning | with Stochastic Gradient Descent,kmb5FuFCZKE,"Mini Batch Gradient Descent is an algorithm that helps to speed up learning while dealing with a large dataset.

Instead of updating the weight parameters after assessing the entire dataset, Mini Batch Gradient Descent updates weight parameters after assessing the small batch of the dataset. Thus we can make much progress before our model sees the entire dataset. Thus the learning can be very fast.

In the video, we also saw Stochastic Gradient Descent, which updates the weight parameter after evaluating every data point or data record. Stochastic Gradient Descent has its own disadvantages as well, which is overcome by the Mini Batch Gradient Descent. 

So, in practice, we don't use Stochastic Gradient Descent but we use Mini Batch Gradient descent while dealing with large datasets. And we use simple, Batch Gradient Descent while dealing with small datasets.

Dropout in Neural Network is a regularization technique in Deep Learning to overcome overfitting. 

When your training accuracy is very high, but test accuracy is very low, the model highly overfits the training dataset set and struggles to make good predictions on the test dataset.

Overfitting in Deep Learning can be the result of having a very deep neural network or a high number of neurons. With Dropout in Neural Network, we drop certain neurons randomly, and thus, we create a simple network that will generate decision boundary that fits well in both training as well as test dataset.

If our model is not overfitting, then we need not use Dropout Regularization. But when our model is overfitting, only then do we use Dropout in Neural Network.

3.) ReLU activation function 
4.) Softmax activation function

All the activation function have some advantages and disadvantages of their own.

We use Sigmoid function at the output neuron of the binary classification. While we use softmax activation function at output layer for multi-class classification.

Supervised learning is a type of Machine Learning which learns from the labelled data.

A data which has a particular label or value assigned to it, is a labelled data.

As we are already providing the right answer, we can say that the model is learning under our supervision. Thus we call it Supervised Learning.

There are two types of Supervised Learning :
1. Classification
2. Regression

610,UC4UJ26WkceqONNF5S26OiVw,Desk Break Deep Squats to Open Tight Hips with Mandy 🏋️‍♀️💪,b5FcTPe53WM,"#shorts

Time for another routine brain-body shift where we take a break from building strong minds to learn how to build strong bodies! 🧠💪

In a world where many of us are glued to our chairs for hours, our lower body often suffers from decreased strength and mobility. Here we have wide stance deep squats – a powerful movement to counteract the perils of a sedentary lifestyle. These squats are fantastic for engaging the muscles of the entire lower body, including the lower back, glutes, thighs, and hips, promoting strength and mobility. By adopting a wider stance, we also engage the inner thigh muscles and ensure a more stable base, which is excellent for posture and balance, while at the same time really opening up our hips that are often times too tight. Performing deep squats can help alleviate some of the stiffness and discomfort associated with prolonged sitting, making it easier to move through our day with energy and agility. Try these on your next desk break!

If you resonate with this vision and want to see it manifest in reality consider becoming a patron:
https://patreon.com/ProjectLiminality

Better yet, to the degree to which you can find and nurture Miracle Consciousness in yourself, start perceiving Miracles from that place
For myself this text proved most helpful in that regard: https://acim.org/acim/en/

The instrument will still take some time to build but once finished the brilliance of the musicians will be the last bottleneck
Miracles can be perceived in potentiality today and manifest in actuality tomorrow

Let's create a more beautiful world together!

Jim talks with recurring guest Forrest Landry about civilization design. They discuss the meaning of the concept, toolkits for problem-solving, why this work matters now, local hill-climbing, preconditions for sustainability, cultivating an epistemic commons, non-relativistic ethics, value ethics, grounding good choices in relationship, the endurance of cities, how metaphysics provides a foundation for ethics, going beyond explore & exploit, accounting for human nature, transmission of cultural dynamics, having a complete value set, 3 dimensions of human relationship, the invention of monogamy, moving away from sexual egalitarianism, making the unconscious conscious, the balance between cooperation & competition, finding the right level of consideration, absolute & relative metrics, subsidiarity, making choices on the basis of desire, societal congruence levels, what folks should do to start building a better civilization, femoral group process, transcendental design, and much more.",2023-06-23T14:34:24Z,680,18,0,false,PT1H29M58S,1
621,UCERg_YsX7Cu6XR2C3J-nEaA,The Power of Example: Applying the Philosophy of Forrest Landry to Education,hHaMoXN63QA,"Looking deeply into educational practices, we can see systemic cognitive-perception capacities active in learning that the pedagogies depend on. The philosopher, Forrest Landry, sets out a systemic view of reality (ontology; what is) what can be observed to operate as set in the perceptions of learners. Once we know what ‘moves’ perception passes through on track through analytic phases towards a creative expression, we can better scaffold this. Drawing examples from Literature studies, Landry’s axiom 2 is seen to be fundamental in progressive intellectual development up to undergraduate level and beyond.

**Correction: when I give an example from Ska music, I give a very UK perspective which does not cover the full origins of Ska music and mostly expresses something about what happens when it hits UK cities.

The multi-talented Forrest Landry joins us for this podcast episode.

This is definitely a full stack episode! We explore: why asking the right questions is so important, what is a good basis of choice, the critical difference between judgement and discernment, reflexive problem-solving across cultures, the risks posed by geoengineering, and much, much more.

Many of Forrests’ writings are available on his business website Magic Flight.Com.

1. Ivan Moscovich, Mind Benders: Games of Shape
It was one of his first books he remembers having ""new"". His father was probably the one who gave this to him during Christmas.

2. Vladimir Koziakin, Mazes
A ""hand down"" Christmas gift. He was around 7 or 8. He still keeps it with him.

3. J.R.R. Tolkien, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings
He found these on his father bookshelf.

4. Jonathan Livingston Seagull, Richard Bach
He may have been 8 or 9 years old when he read it. His father picked it up by chance when they were browsing at a yard sale. His father said ""I think you might like this one"", and gave it to him. 
It is the only book on any spiritual topic that his father ever gave him. 

5. Jane Roberts, The Nature of Personal Reality
The book was given to him by his father's friend who was a computer scientist. He was around 14 or 15 years old.  

6. Douglas Hofstadter, Godel, Escher, Bach
One of the first books he purchased himself, at great effort, from a bookstore some 20 miles from where he lived.

7. Manfred Schroeder, Fractals, Chaos, Power Laws
This book really helped him to see the abstract connection between simple mathematics and relevant aspects of nature.

8. Gardner D. Hiscox, Henley's Formulas for Home and Workshop 
He purchased it from a used bookstore when he was in mid teens. It inspired him to understand early tech.

9. J. R. Pierce, Symbols, Signals and Noise

Forrest Landry holds a unique polymathic background as a master woodworker, software architect, engineer, author, philosopher, mystic, researcher, and many other roles and titles. Forrest founded Magic-Flight after spending a large portion of his career in software architecture roles for the FBI, DARPA, and the Library of Congress. Notably, his development of the Immanent Metaphysics (IM) has enabled both broad and deep insights into the nature of the core questions of epistemology and ontology: what is, and how do we know? Using the IM, and developing a novel solution in community governance (Ephemeral Group Process), Forrest holds unique insight into the designs and thinking necessary to steward life and earth into the next levels of right relationship with all of life and nature. In true Forrest style, this Sensemaker in Residence will be in open Q&A format. Bring your questions, interests, hopes, and dreams, and perhaps together we can deepen curiosities, expand understandings, and celebrate the gift of life through community and conversation at the Stoa.

Forrest Landry is a philosopher, founder, writer, researcher, scientist, engineer, and craftsman. He has a unique set of skills in large scale systems design and worked on many software projects in the business and government sectors. His most original and insightful work is in the area of metaphysics – the study of what is, what is the nature of being, what is the nature of knowing, and by what means we make good choices. His foundational work “The Immanent Metaphysics” reflects a decades long effort to restore legitimacy to the practice of metaphysics and construct a rigorous, coherent and precise statement of Ethics.

Time for another routine brain-body shift where we take a break from building strong minds to learn how to build strong bodies! 🧠💪

Here we have the overhead press. It's a potent upper body strengthener. But beyond this specific lift, heavy lifting in general offers substantial benefits. Note that when lifting heavy close to your personal record, the amount of reps will be lower since the lift will obviously be much harder. In return for this effort, lifting heavy brings many benefits to those of us who spend long hours sitting at a desk. Heavy lifting combats muscle weakness and poor posture, boosts metabolism, and even enhances bone density.

This lift is called the Romanian Deadlift, or RDL and it's great for strengthening and stretching our hamstrings! These muscles in the back of our thighs are so often at rest and in a shortened position while we sit at a desk all day working or studying. In fact, sitting for long hours regularly can lead to these muscles adapting to this shortened position, which in turn can lead to a reduction in their flexibility and length.

We're spending lots of our time learning and doing cool stuff on our computers, but we don't want this to be at the expense of our bodies. So on your next break, give RDLs a try. You don't need to have access to a barbell and weights. You can use anything sufficiently heavy enough for you, even a water jug could work. Just hinge backwards at your hips until you feel a nice stretch in your hamstrings, and use your glutes to lift you back up, rather than your back.

Time for another routine brain-body shift where we take a break from building strong minds to learn how to build strong bodies! 🧠💪

Does your lower back ever ache from sitting too long after studying or working for long periods? Strengthening our lower backs may help with that! As we know, back pain is common, particularly as we age, but it's not inevitable, especially if we start strengthening it now!

This movement is called the reverse hyper extension, and all we need to perform it is something to lay on, like a box as I'm using here, a bench, or even a counter top or mattress. We simply use the muscles in our lower backs to lift our legs behind us. As a bonus, our glutes become engaged at the top too, which as we know, are at rest while we sit.

685,UC4UJ26WkceqONNF5S26OiVw,Desk Break Squats with Mandy 🏋️‍♀️,K6LawLwO9Fk,"#shorts

Time for another routine brain-body shift where we take a break from building strong minds to learn how to build strong bodies! 🧠💪

Squats are one of the most popular lifts, and for good reason! Not only do they strengthen the legs, core, and lower back, but they also increase hip and knee mobility, all of which are greatly needed if we find ourselves sitting at a desk studying or working for long periods.

Many people may shy away from this lift due to not having the mobility to squat deep. If you can't perform the full range of motion, that's ok! It may take some practice. In the mean time, you can perform a relatively shallow squat as I'm demonstrating here with either low or no added weight while you work on your hip, knee, and ankle mobility that will sooner or later allow you to reach a fuller range of motion.

So let's take a break from sitting, give our brains a rest, and squat!

Time for another routine brain-body shift where we take a break from building strong minds to learn how to build strong bodies! 🧠💪

In a world where many of us are glued to our chairs for hours, our lower body often suffers from decreased strength and mobility. Here we have wide stance deep squats – a powerful movement to counteract the perils of a sedentary lifestyle. These squats are fantastic for engaging the muscles of the entire lower body, including the lower back, glutes, thighs, and hips, promoting strength and mobility. By adopting a wider stance, we also engage the inner thigh muscles and ensure a more stable base, which is excellent for posture and balance, while at the same time really opening up our hips that are often times too tight. Performing deep squats can help alleviate some of the stiffness and discomfort associated with prolonged sitting, making it easier to move through our day with energy and agility. Try these on your next desk break!

698,UC4UJ26WkceqONNF5S26OiVw,Plate Raises for Better Posture & Strength with Mandy 🍽️🙋‍♀️💪,9IopsUN9P48,"#shorts

Time for another routine brain-body shift where we take a break from building strong minds to learn how to build strong bodies! 🧠💪

Here we have a simple, effective exercise called the plate raise. This movement is fantastic for sculpting our shoulders, improving posture, and enhancing overall upper body strength, which is  essential for countering the slouch and stiffness from hours spent at desks.

You don't even need traditional weight plates to get started. Any large object with a bit of weight, like a heavy book, or even a large water jug will do! The key is in the motion: a smooth, controlled raise above your head and a careful lower back down, keeping our core engaged and posture intact.

Time for another routine brain-body shift where we take a break from building strong minds to learn how to build strong bodies! 🧠💪

Let's face it, unless we have a physically demanding job or are actively pursuing fitness, our lifestyles are often pretty sedentary these days. Spending hours at our desks can take a toll on our upper body strength and posture. That's where dips come in – a simple yet effective body weight exercise we can do almost anywhere. Dips target our triceps, chest, and shoulders, strengthening these key areas weakened by prolonged sitting. They're not just about building muscle though, they also enhance our posture, boost core stability, and even help protect our joints. And the best part? We can even do them using only a counter top with an L-shaped corner!

So let's take a break from sitting, give our brains a rest, and squat!

Time for another routine brain-body shift where we take a break from building strong minds to learn how to build strong bodies! 🧠💪

Squats are one of the most popular lifts, and for good reason! Not only do they strengthen the legs, core, and lower back, but they also increase hip and knee mobility, all of which are greatly needed if we find ourselves sitting at a desk studying or working for long periods.

Many people may shy away from this lift due to not having the mobility to squat deep. If you can't perform the full range of motion, that's ok! It may take some practice. In the mean time, you can perform a relatively shallow squat as I'm demonstrating here with either low or no added weight while you work on your hip, knee, and ankle mobility that will sooner or later allow you to reach a fuller range of motion.

So let's take a break from sitting, give our brains a rest, and squat!

701,UC4UJ26WkceqONNF5S26OiVw,Using Pull-Ups to Combat Bad Posture with Mandy 👩‍💻💪,s8SCa3LqvoA,"#shorts 

Time for another routine brain-body shift where we take a break from building strong minds to learn how to build strong bodies! 🧠💪

Here's an easier variation to the traditional pull-up that makes use of half-reps, which takes out the hardest part of the movement of pulling up from the very bottom with arms locked out. As people who sit behind a screen for long periods of time, our upper backs definitely suffer from slouching and rolled shoulders. Pull ups are a great way to strengthen the upper back to improve posture, and the only thing we need to perform this movement is something to hang from! If you don't yet have the strength to pull up at all, hanging itself is a great strength builder!

Following the Discussion:

Regarding the question of considering a function that only counts occurrences of letters and not the order: below is the counterexample showing that we don't have the anti-diagonal behaviour that we want for the commutative case to work (denoting by ""\eps"" the empty string)

         \eps    |    a      |     b
\eps | f(\eps)   |   f(a)    |    f(b)
a    |  f(a)     |   f(aa)   |     ...
b    |  f(b)     |   f(ba)   |     ...

Explanation: the third counterdiagonal does not (necessarily) contain identical values (f(aa) might be different from f(b)), meaning a permutation invariant function still won’t give us perfectly counterdiagonal matrices, as needed for the AAK constructive proof

Explanation 2: To use the constructive proof of the AAK theorem, we need to be able to index the entries of the Hankel matrix using natural numbers (to use the embedding into Z and the Fourier isomorphism). This property is equivalent to asking for the matrix to have constant anti-diagonals. In the example above, if we set \epsilon=0, a=1, b=2, we have that f(1+1) outputs a different value than f(0+2). Here the issue does not derive from the ordering of the string itself, but from the fact that we have more than one letter. There is a version of the AAK theory which applies for this setting, but unfortunately it is also not constructive.",2023-03-16T08:53:45Z,165,3,0,false,PT56M32S,0

781,UCwBhBDsqiQflTMLy2epbQVw,Neural Network learns the Mandelbrot set [Part 1],QmPBLroyHB0,"Every frame is rendered by passing each pixel's x, y coordinates through a neural network, which outputs a value between (0, 1) that is used as the pixel's value. 

This network is trained to approximate the value of the Mandelbrot function evaluated at x, y, so the image improves as the network learns. 

The color does not indicate anything about the approximation, I just think it looks cool. 

See the code for more details:
https://github.com/MaxRobinsonTheGreat/mandelbrotnn

This is an overfit problem, or rather, there is no such thing as ""over"" fitting. You can only ever come short of an accurate fit.

Ultimately it would require larger networks, longer training times, ever diminishing learning rates, and larger samples of training data points to improve the approximation, but it is interesting to see just how well the network can fit the set with pragmatic limitations.
The final attempt took about 10 hours to train on my poor MX150, so I don't think I'll be scaling up anytime soon.

SIMULATION RULES:
The environment is a grid made up of cells. 
The environment is populated by organisms that are structures of cells, which perform different functions depending on their color:

Orange (Mouth) - Eats nearby food (gray blue cells)
Green (Producer) - Produces nearby food
Blue (Mover) - Allows movement
Red (Killer) - Kills nearby organisms
Purple (Armor) - Protects from red cells
Gray with slit (Eye) - Perceives nearby cells and decides movement

The goal of each organism is to eat enough food (gray blue cells) to reproduce. Reproduction can result in mutated offspring, and offspring with more valuable cell structures propagate throughout the environment.

This is a showcase of the new update to the life engine, which allows organisms to evolve eyes and brains. An eye cell faces a direction, looks forward a certain number of cells and observes the first cell it sees. Based on its observation, the organism can either move towards the observed cell, move away from it, or ignore and move randomly. 

These relatively simple rules have resulted in some really fascinating results. Organisms can become extremely efficient predators, hunting down undefended organisms and avoiding danger themselves. In response, static organisms evolve cells that ward off predators even though these cell types may be useless. This is a form of camouflage. In other cases, organisms evolve cells that bring them closer together, resulting in cooperative swarms. Other organisms take advantage of this by evolving the same cells and using them to lure in prey. 
I demonstrate some of these phenomenon in this video.

Overall, the addition of vision to the simulation has resulted in increasingly complex organisms and ecosystems, which parallels the effects of vision in the real world's evolutionary history. I talk a little bit about these similarities.

There has also been a color scheme update, which I think looks nicer. Let me know what you think.

785,UCwBhBDsqiQflTMLy2epbQVw,Neural network learns the Mandelbrot [Part 2],lFHJqay0zCs,"Hey all! This massive improvement in approximation was by the suggestion of reddit user u/jnbrrn, who suggested the use of fourier features as an input for the network. Essentially this means rather than giving the network an (x, y) coordinate, I am now giving it an an encoding of [cos(x), sin(x), cos(2x), sin(2x), cos(3x), ...] up to order 32 of the fourier series for both x and y coordinates. 
This improved the approximation dramatically and significantly reduced training time. This network was trained for 150 epochs, where it's loss finally plateaued regardless of the learning rate.
The rest of the network is the same architecture as the previous attempt, though slightly smaller to fit on my gpu.

Here is the video and paper that explain the theoretical basis behind this work:
https://youtu.be/nVA6K6Sn2S4
https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10739
I believe r/jnbrrn is actually one of the co authors of this paper, so huge thanks to them for the reference!

The Fourier series is another robust universal function approximator, and it's fascinating to see it work so well on this problem. Hooray for calculus!

Simulation Rules: https://github.com/MaxRobinsonTheGreat/EvolutionSimulator/blob/master/V2README.md
Well I've put together a pretty decent update for the life engine! There are a few new cool features that I think make the simulation much more fun and efficient. First, there are graphs for various ecosystem statistics that let you see the population, number of species, cellular structure, and mutation rate change over time. There is also a new simulation control that allows food to be randomly dropped into the world automatically, which has some very weird effects on the evolution of the organisms. Finally, there is now a control that toggles rendering that allows you to run the simulation much faster without visuals. These have all been on my list for a while and I'm happy with how they turned out.

Yes I know it says I'm using the trial version of canvasjs, the full version costs money and I'm stingy. Don't @ me.

SIMULATION RULES:
The environment is a grid made up of cells. 
The environment is populated by organisms that are structures of cells, which perform different functions depending on their color:

Orange (Mouth) - Eats nearby food (gray blue cells)
Green (Producer) - Produces nearby food
Blue (Mover) - Allows movement
Red (Killer) - Kills nearby organisms
Purple (Armor) - Protects from red cells
Gray with slit (Eye) - Perceives nearby cells and decides movement

The goal of each organism is to eat enough food (gray blue cells) to reproduce. Reproduction can result in mutated offspring, and offspring with more valuable cell structures propagate throughout the environment.

I explain why it is so important to carefully analyze your own research contributions through the story of 3 recent publications from my research group at Cornell University. In all three cases did we first invent something far more complicated, only to realize that the gains could be attributed to something far simple and different from what we had initially believed.

937,UCmtyQOKKmrMVaKuRXz02jbQ,Complex Behaviour from Simple Rules: 3 Simulations,kzwT3wQWAHE,"A small display of some of the surprisingly intricate patterns and behaviours that can arise from relatively simple rules. More information about each of the simulations below.

These simulations were made in Unity, and coded with C# and HLSL.
You can find the project files at the links below.

---- 1. Reaction-Diffusion ----
This is a simulation of two chemicals (A and B). Both diffuse over time (A faster than B).
The simulation space is initially filled with A, and just a small region has some of chemical B. Over time, more A is gradually added (controlled by a parameter called feedRate), while B is gradually removed (controlled by the parameter removeRate). Finally, there's a reaction that takes place: when one particle of chemical A is in the presence of two particles of chemical B, it will be converted into B.

One could simulate the individual particles of both chemicals, but more common (and the approach I went with as well) is to just store a value for the concentrations of both chemicals at each pixel. The probability of an A particle coming into contact with two B particles can be determined by the equation: probablityOfReaction = concentrationA * concentrationB * concentrationB. Here is the tutorial I followed when creating my implementation: https://www.karlsims.com/rd.html

The colours in the simulation are mainly based on the concentrations of the two chemicals, but to spice things up I also added some colouring based on how fast the concentrations are changing at each point.


---- 2. Multiple Neighbourhood Cellular Automata ----
This is a technique developed by someone who goes by Slackermanz online (you can find many awesome examples under that name on Twitter).

In this simulation, the state of each pixel (called a cell) is initially randomized between 0 and 1. On every frame, the state of each cell is updated based on the states of all the cells inside various ""neighbourhoods"" around it. These neighboughhoods are ring-shaped, with each ring defined by a min and max radius, along with two min/max values called 'alive' and 'dead'. Once all the states inside a ring have been added up, the sum is compared to the ring's alive and dead ranges, and depending on which range the sum falls into, the cell's state increases or decreases by some small amount (if the sum is inside neither range, the state remains the same).

This already gives interesting results, but there are some more nuances that can be added. For example, instead of the rings directly affecting the cell's state, they can contribute to several 'potential' states, and whichever of these is most different from the cell's current state becomes the new state.

My implementation is based on Slackermanz code, which you can find here: https://github.com/Slackermanz/VulkanAutomata
Slackermanz also has a YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmoNsNuM0M9VsIXfm2cHPiA


---- 3. Slime Mould Simulation ----
In this simulation we have a lot lot of particles, each of which leaves a trail behind itself as it moves. These trails diffuse and evaporate over time. Each particle also has three circular sensors arranged in an arc in front it. These are used to detect the intensity of the trail, and the particle turns towards whichever detects the highest intensity. Some randomness is added to the turning as well.

The idea for this comes from this paper: https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/980579
I also have a video exploring it in some more depth: https://youtu.be/X-iSQQgOd1A

Some notes:
• I made a little build where you can play with the atmosphere settings yourself, which you can find over here if you're interested: https://sebastian.itch.io/atmosphere-experiment

• A number of knowledgeable people have pointed out in the comments that reality is not nearly as simple as my little diagram around the 4 and a half minute mark, and that light does not literally wiggle up and down like a wave, so please note that the diagram is incorrect!

• This project was inspired by the game Outer Wilds, which I highly recommend playing!

Note:
Two issues have been pointed out which I'd like to address: (will add these fixes at end of next video)
1) changing resolution causes uv out of bounds error. This can be fixed by checking mesh.uv.Length == uv.Length before assigning the uvs in ConstructMesh method.
2) biome colours appearing in wrong places when zoomed out (on certain devices). To fix this, mipmaps need to be disabled on the planet texture. In the ColourGenerator, replace with:
texture = new Texture2D(textureResolution, settings.biomeColourSettings.biomes.Length, TextureFormat.RGBA32, false);﻿

1027,UCcIXc5mJsHVYTZR1maL5l9w,How To Read AI Research Papers Effectively,K6Wui3mn-uI,"According to a recent survey, over two-thirds (66.9%) of developers and machine learning teams are planning production deployments of LLM apps in the next 12 months or “as fast as possible” – and 14.1% are already in production! Given the rapid rate of progress and constant drumbeat of new foundation models, orchestration frameworks and open source libraries – as well as the workaday challenges of getting an app into production – it can be difficult to find the time to digest and read the dizzying array of cutting-edge AI research papers hitting arXiv. 

That task has never been more critical, however, as the time between academic discovery and industry application moves from years to weeks. How can teams discover and read AI research papers quickly without losing nuance, with an eye toward pragmatic application, while balancing real-world challenges?

In this session, Aparna Dhinakaran – who blends a background in academia with experience overseeing AI in production and troubleshooting real-world AI systems as co-founder and Chief Product Officer of Arize AI – will be joined by data scientist and machine learning engineer Amber Roberts to talk through strategies for understanding and applying the latest research, reducing mean time to application. The session will include an exercise of digesting 1-2 to be announced papers (will be a recent release!) in real-time.

1028,UCcIXc5mJsHVYTZR1maL5l9w,New course with Neo4J: Knowledge Graphs for RAG,jMKRUo4wVKA,"Enroll now: https://bit.ly/3PaCeAK

Knowledge graphs enhance AI application development by connecting structured and unstructured data sources for a comprehensive view of complex, real-world scenarios. They go beyond traditional databases as they connect data from both structured and unstructured sources, providing an intuitive way to model complex, real-world scenarios. 

Today, we’re introducing Knowledge Graphs for RAG, a new short course built in collaboration with Neo4j, where you’ll learn how to leverage knowledge graphs within retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications.

Upon completing this course, you will:

- Understand the basics of how knowledge graphs store data by using nodes to represent entities and edges to represent relationships between nodes.
- Use Neo4j's query language, Cypher, to retrieve information from a fun graph of movie and actor data.
- Add a vector index to a knowledge graph to represent unstructured text data and find relevant texts using vector similarity search.
- Build a knowledge graph of text documents from scratch, using publicly available financial and investment documents as the demo use case
- Explore techniques for connecting multiple knowledge graphs and using complex queries for comprehensive data retrieval.
- Write advanced Cypher queries to retrieve relevant information from the graph and format it for inclusion in your prompt to a large language model (LLM)

Start enhancing the performance of LLMs with knowledge graphs.

1034,UCcIXc5mJsHVYTZR1maL5l9w,New course with CircleCI: Automated Testing for LLMOps,Ep7uaxwN-mQ,"Enroll now: https://bit.ly/47HoFza

In this course, you will learn how to create a continuous integration (CI) workflow to evaluate your LLM applications at every iteration for more efficient application development.

When building applications with generative AI, model behavior is less predictable than traditional software. Systematic testing can make a difference in saving you development time and cost. 

CI, a key part of LLMOps, involves making small changes to software in development and testing them to identify bugs before they escalate, allowing faster and more cost-effective fixes, enabling teams to concentrate on building new features and facilitates quicker product iteration and delivery.

After completing this course, you will be able to:

- Write robust LLM evaluations to cover common problems like hallucinations, data drift, and harmful or offensive output.
- Build a continuous integration workflow to automatically evaluate every change to your application.
- Orchestrate your CI workflow to run specific evaluations at different stages of development.

Elevate your LLM-based testing process and learn from instructor Rob Zuber, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at CircleCI.

1035,UCcIXc5mJsHVYTZR1maL5l9w,Prompt-Engineering for Open-Source LLMs,f32dc5M2Mn0,"Turns out prompt-engineering is different for open-source LLMs! Actually, your prompts need to be engineered when switching across any LLM — even when OpenAI changes versions behind the scenes, which is why people get confused why their prompts don’t work anymore. Transparency of the entire prompt is critical to effectively squeezing out performance from the model. Most frameworks struggle with this, as they try to abstract everything away or obscure the prompt to seem like they’re managing something behind the scenes. But prompt-engineering is not software engineering, so the workflow is entirely different to succeed. Finally, RAG, a form of prompt-engineering, is an easy way to boost performance using search technology. In fact, you only need 80 lines of code to implement the whole thing and get 80%+ of what you need from it (link to open-source repo). You’ll learn how to run RAG at scale, across millions of documents.

What you’ll learn from this workshop:

- Prompt engineering vs. software engineering
- Open vs. closed LLMs: completely different prompts
- Push accuracy by taking advantage of prompt transparency
- Best practices for prompt-engineering open LLMs
- Prompt-engineering with search (RAG)
- How to implement RAG on millions of documents (demo)

Announcing LLMOps, a new short course built in collaboration with Google Cloud, and taught by Erwin Huizenga, Machine Learning Technical Lead at Google.

In this course, you’ll learn Large Language Model Operations (LLMOps) best practices as you design and automate the steps to tune a large language model (LLM) for a specific task and deploy it as a callable API. 

You'll go through the LLMOps pipeline of pre-processing training data for supervised instruction tuning and adapt a supervised tuning pipeline to train and deploy a custom LLM. You’ll get hands-on and tune an LLM to act as a question-answering coding expert. You can apply these techniques to customize your LLM for diverse use cases.

The key steps of creating the LLMOps pipeline that you’ll explore include:

- Retrieving and transforming training data for supervised fine-tuning of an LLM.
- Versioning your data and tuned models to track your tuning experiments. 
- Configuring an open-source supervised tuning pipeline and then executing that pipeline to train and then deploy a tuned LLM.
- Outputting and studying safety scores to responsibly monitor and filter your LLM application's behavior.
- Trying out the tuned and deployed LLM yourself!

The tools you’ll practice with include BigQuery data warehouse, the open-source Kubeflow Pipelines, and Google Cloud. 

Prepare to tune an LLM while you work with and build an LLMOps pipeline.

1039,UCcIXc5mJsHVYTZR1maL5l9w,New short course: Advanced Retrieval for AI with Chroma,ewfTtQUvfJU,"Enroll now: https://bit.ly/3RD9tgK

Information Retrieval (IR) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) are only effective if the information retrieved from a database as a result of a query is relevant to the query and its application. 

Too often, queries return semantically similar results but don’t answer the question posed. They may also return irrelevant material which can distract the LLM from the correct results. 

This course, built in collaboration with Chroma, teaches advanced retrieval techniques to improve the relevancy of retrieved results.

The techniques covered include:  

- Query Expansion: Expanding user queries improves information retrieval by including related concepts and keywords. Utilizing an LLM makes this traditional technique even more effective. - Another form of expansion has the LLM suggest a possible answer to the query which is then included in the query.
- Cross-encoder reranking: Reranking retrieval results to select the results most relevant to your query improves your results
- Training and utilizing Embedding Adapters: Adding an adapter layer to reshape embeddings can improve retrieval by emphasizing elements relevant to your application.

Large language models (LLMs) are trained on human-generated text, but additional methods are needed to align an LLM with human values and preferences. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is currently the main method for aligning LLMs to make them more helpful, honest, and safe. 

In this course, you will gain a conceptual understanding of the RLHF training process, and then practice applying RLHF to tune an LLM. You will: 

- Explore the two datasets (“preference” and “prompt”) that are used in RLHF training.
- Use the open source Google Cloud Pipeline Components Library to fine-tune the Llama 2 model with RLHF.
- Assess the tuned LLM against the original base model by comparing loss curves and using the “Side-by-Side (SxS)” method.

1133,UCp6QoHyDne8FErMg7a99-Ug,Neural networks create short videos. Footage. Lines from the center...,ZMHbZtNiSAI,"Neural networks create short videos. Footage. Lines from the center...

A neural network is a type of artificial intelligence system that is able to analyze and process large amounts of data in order to learn and make decisions. When creating short videos or footage using a neural network, the process typically involves feeding the system a series of images or video frames and allowing it to generate new content based on the patterns and features it has learned from the input data.

In the context of creating videos from lines originating from the center, the neural network may be trained to recognize and manipulate visual elements that are centered around a central point. This could involve creating visual effects that radiate outwards from the center of the frame, or incorporating symmetry and balance in the composition of the video.

The neural network may also be programmed to add dynamic movement or transitions to the video that draw the viewer's attention towards the central focal point. This could involve animated elements such as lines, shapes, or particles that move or interact in a visually interesting way.

Overall, using a neural network to create videos from lines originating from the center can result in visually striking and unique content that leverages the power of artificial intelligence to push the boundaries of creative expression.

The concept of creating a neural network in the same ball where the terminator came from involves building a sophisticated artificial intelligence system inspired by the Terminator movie franchise. This neural network would be designed to have advanced learning capabilities and the ability to adapt and evolve over time.

In the Terminator movies, Skynet is a self-aware artificial intelligence system that becomes hostile towards humanity and launches a nuclear war against them. The idea of creating a neural network in the same ball as the terminator could imply creating a system that has the potential to become intelligent and powerful enough to pose a threat to humanity, much like Skynet in the movies.

However, it is important to note that the creation of a neural network in the same ball as the terminator would not necessarily result in a dangerous and hostile AI system. Neural networks are used in many beneficial applications, such as image and speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, and medical diagnosis.

The music produced by the neural network spans a variety of genres and moods, from classical and jazz music to modern electronic rhythms. When watching the video, you will notice that some compositions may be indistinguishable from works created by live musicians, which highlights the efficiency and accuracy of neural networks in the field of music.

It is important to note that these musical compositions are not simply copies of existing works, but original creations generated by the neural network based on its training. This provides the ability to create new and unique music using neural network synthesis.

Thus, the video shows that the synthesis of neural networks and music produces amazing results. This technology allows us to look at music in a new way, expanding the possibilities of creating and interpreting sound art.

Meditation music combined with images generated by a neural network can be a wonderful way to relax and enjoy an atmosphere of peace and beauty.

First, choose calm and meditative music that will help relieve stress and create a conducive atmosphere for practicing meditation. Sounds such as nature sounds, quiet instrumental music, or specially created meditation tracks can be the perfect backdrop for your practice.

Then, to complement the music, select images generated by the neural network that you like and play on the screen. As you enjoy meditation, look at these paintings and allow yourself to be absorbed in their beauty and mysticism. These images can be beautiful girls that are visually appealing and create a sense of harmony.

Pay attention to the girls in the images, observe their images carefully. Notice their beauty, grace and elegance. Let your imagination travel among these girls, imagining them in a calm and harmonious environment. Visualizing beautiful and calm images can help you create a state of peace and relaxation.

As you meditate with music and images in the background, focus on your breathing and allow yourself to drift into a state of peace and tranquility. Pay special attention to the sensations you experience within yourself during the practice and allow yourself to simply be in the moment.

Overall, a combination of meditation music and neural network images of beautiful girls can create the perfect atmosphere for your practice. It will help you relax, disconnect from everyday worries and simply enjoy the beauty and tranquility.

Listen and try to cast aside your worldly worries...,NBUoZlRnI50,"Relaxation music helps relieve stress, calm the nervous system and create an atmosphere of peace and harmony. Here are some genres and songs that may help you relax:

1. Ambient: Compositions in this genre are usually very calm and meditative, with pleasant soundscapes. This type of music is aimed at creating an atmosphere of relaxation and a state of self-immersion.

2. Instrumental music: Musical compositions in which instrumental playing predominates, without words or lyrics, also promote relaxation. Melodies played on piano, guitar or violin often have a calming effect on listeners.

3. Classical Music: Some works by classical composers, such as the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven or Frederic Chopin, can create a relaxing atmosphere.

4. New Age Music: This genre of music combines elements of ambient, instrumental and classical music to create a soothing effect. Many New Age compositions use natural sounds, such as the sound of seas, birdsong or waterfalls.

5. Meditation music: Specially created meditation compositions help you focus, relax and free your mind from thoughts. The rhythms and sounds of Tibetan bowls and gongs are often used, which promote deep contemplation.

There is no single right music for relaxation; each person prefers his own style and sound to achieve a state of peace. Therefore, it is recommended to experiment with different genres and compositions until you find the one that helps you relax the most.Music for relaxation and harmony is a musical genre that is specially created to create a calm and meditative atmosphere.

Abstract: 
Deep learning has been used to demonstrate end-to-end neural network learning for autonomous vehicle control from raw sensory input. While LiDAR sensors provide reliably accurate information, existing end-to-end driving solutions are mainly based on cameras since processing 3D data requires a large memory footprint and computation cost. On the other hand, increasing the robustness of these systems is also critical; however, even estimating the model’s uncertainty is very challenging due to the cost of sampling-based methods. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust LiDAR-based end-to-end navigation framework. We first introduce Fast-LiDARNet that is based on sparse convolution kernel optimization and hardware-aware model design. We then propose Hybrid Evidential Fusion that directly estimates the uncertainty of the prediction from only a single forward pass and then fuses the control predictions intelligently. We evaluate our system on a full-scale vehicle and demonstrate lane-stable as well as navigation capabilities. In the presence of out-of-distribution events (e.g., sensor failures), our system significantly improves robustness and reduces the number of takeovers in the real world.",2021-05-23T15:30:00Z,14355,284,0,false,PT1M42S,11

1460,UCtslD4DGH6PKyG_1gFAX7sg,Co-Learning of Task and Sensor Placement for Soft Robotics (Teaser),MSa7D0FvxqY,"Unlike rigid robots which operate with compact degrees of freedom, soft robots must reason about an infinite dimensional state space. Mapping this continuum state space presents significant challenges, especially when working with a finite set of discrete sensors. Reconstructing the robot’s state from these sparse inputs is challenging, especially since sensor location has a profound downstream impact on the richness of learned models for robotic tasks. In this work, we present a novel representation for co-learning sensor placement and complex tasks. Specifically, we present a neural architecture which processes on-board sensor information to learn a salient and sparse selection of placements for optimal task performance. We evaluate our model and learning
algorithm on six soft robot morphologies for various supervised learning tasks, including tactile sensing and proprioception. We also highlight applications to soft robot motion subspace visualization and control. Our method demonstrates superior performance in task learning to algorithmic and human baselines while also learning sensor placements and latent spaces that are semantically meaningful.

Abstract:
In this work, we present a data-driven simulation and training engine capable of learning end-to-end autonomous vehicle control policies using only sparse rewards. By leveraging real, human-collected trajectories through an environment, we render novel training data that allows virtual agents to drive along a continuum of new local trajectories consistent with the road appearance and semantics, each with a different view of the scene. We demonstrate the ability of policies learned within our simulator to generalize to and navigate in previously unseen real-world roads, without access to any human control labels during training. Our results validate the learned policy onboard a full-scale autonomous vehicle, including in previously un-encountered scenarios, such as new roads and novel, complex, near-crash situations. Our methods are scalable, leverage reinforcement learning, and apply broadly to situations requiring effective perception and robust operation in the physical world.",2020-06-09T19:00:10Z,6999,186,0,false,PT9M59S,9

DISCLAIMER: The following video is synthetic and was created using deep learning with simultaneous speech-to-speech translation as well as video dialogue replacement (CannyAI). 

** NOTE**: The audio quality demonstrated here was additionally degraded since we want to avoid improper use of this technology. The purpose of this video is to excite the class about the potential of deep learning, not to deceive anyone. Thus, we purposely lowered the audio quality before publishing to make the synthetic aspect of this video clearer.

1492,UCtslD4DGH6PKyG_1gFAX7sg,Variational End-to-End Navigation and Localization,aXI4a_Nvcew,"Deep learning has revolutionized the ability to learn ""end-to-end"" autonomous vehicle control directly from raw sensory data. While there have been recent advances on extensions to handle forms of navigation instruction, these works are unable to capture the full distribution of possible actions that could be taken and to reason about localization of the robot within the environment. In this paper, we extend end-to-end driving networks with the ability to understand maps. We define a novel variational network capable of learning from raw camera data of the environment as well as higher level roadmaps to predict (1) a full probability distribution over the possible control commands; and (2) a deterministic control command capable of navigating on the route specified within the map. Additionally, we formulate how our model can be used to localize the robot according to correspondences between the map and the observed visual road topology, inspired by the rough localization that human drivers can perform. We evaluate our algorithms on real-world driving data, and reason about the robustness of the inferred steering commands under various types of rich driving scenarios. In addition, we evaluate our localization algorithm over a new set of roads and intersections which the model has never driven through and demonstrate rough localization in situations without any GPS prior.

Talk Title: Learning Steering Bounds for Parallel Autonomy: Handling Ambiguity in End-to-End Driving

Talk Abstract: 
End-to-end learning is a powerful new strategy for training neural networks from perception to control. While such systems have been shown to perform well for reactionary control, the representation learned is not usable for higher level decision making, such as navigation. We'll discuss the latest methodologies for training end-to-end systems for parallel autonomy, and demonstrate some of the shortcomings when such decision making capability is needed.",2018-04-16T16:20:54Z,6310,92,0,false,PT43M16S,4
